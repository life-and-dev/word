## Research Summary Completed

### Luke's Authorship (from Section 1)
- **Traditional attribution**: Luke the physician, Paul's companion
- **Early testimony**: Irenaeus (c. 180 CE), Muratorian Fragment (c. 170-200 CE), Anti-Marcionite Prologue
- **Internal evidence**: Prologue (Luke 1:1-4) - second-generation author, not eyewitness
- **"We" passages in Acts**: Acts 16:10-17, 20:5-21:18, 27:1-28:16 suggest Paul's companion
- **Medical language debate**: Refuted by Henry Cadbury (1926) - vocabulary is educated Greek, not distinctively medical
- **Unity with Acts**: Two-volume work (Luke-Acts) demonstrated by style, theology, vocabulary
- **Dating**: Most scholars 75-85 CE based on Markan priority, post-70 CE knowledge of Jerusalem destruction
- **Arguments against**: Theological differences from Paul's letters, historical inaccuracies in Acts, late dating
- **Scholarly spectrum**: Traditional (Paul's companion, 60s-70s) → Modified traditional (70s-80s) → Anonymous Pauline tradition → Late anonymous (80s-90s)

### Luke's Historical Environment (from Section 2)
- **Post-70 CE context**: Jerusalem temple destroyed, Judaism transitioning to rabbinic focus
- **Evidence for post-70**: Luke 21:20 (armies surrounding Jerusalem vs. Mark's cryptic language), Luke 19:43-44 (detailed siege description)
- **Theophilus**: "Most excellent" (κράτιστε) suggests high status patron, Greco-Roman literary convention
- **Greco-Roman historiography**: Formal prologue like Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius
- **Mixed Jewish-Gentile audience**: Explains Jewish customs, extends genealogy to Adam, universal salvation emphasis
- **Roman Empire context**: Chronological markers (Luke 2:1-2, 3:1-2), apologetic portrayal of Roman officials
- **Delay of Parousia**: 40-50 years after Jesus, requires theological adjustment (Holy Spirit, reframed expectation)
- **Sources**: Mark (primary source), Q (hypothetical sayings source), L (unique material - parables, infancy narratives)
- **Third-generation Christianity**: Author and readers depend on transmitted eyewitness tradition

6. **Fulfillment of Scripture** - Jesus fulfills OT prophecy
7. **Journey to Jerusalem** - Geographic and theological movement
