# Word of God

The Bible is considered by many Christians to be [the most authoritative book](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/inspired) in Christianity. It is a collection of many [books](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books) that were [historically](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/history) written by many [authors](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/authors) over centuries.

The Bible contains diverse literary forms including historical narratives, laws, poetry, wisdom literature, apocalyptic writings, epistles, and the gospels. Many biblical [concepts](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts) are expressed through [metaphors](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors) and [symbolism](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/symbolism).

Currently, there are many [Bible Translations](translations.md) available, which differ in language style, translation philosophy, and source texts.

## How to Read the Bible

### Understanding the Original Languages

Unlike English, both Hebrew and Greek do not have lowercase letters. In both languages, the same word can have multiple meanings depending on context.

Therefore, it is up to the translator's [interpretation](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations) to decide how a scripture should be translated. This is often [influenced by the church denomination](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history) that sponsored the translation. Thankfully, the repetitive Hebrew style of writing and different witnesses from Bible times provide ways to cross-check important concepts.

### Understanding Bible Structure

The Bible was divided into testaments, chapters, verses, and titles—none of which were part of the original manuscripts. Sometimes these divisions interrupt the flow of a message or change the originally intended subject.

Most modern Bibles are not arranged in chronological order. Bible translators chose to group similar books together rather than maintain chronological sequence.

### The Importance of Personal Study

Commentaries, creeds, sermons, Christian books, apps, videos, and websites (including this one) are all based on human [interpretations](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations). They should inspire you to turn to the Bible, but should not replace the Bible itself.

It is **your own responsibility** to search the scriptures and ask for [God's Spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit) to guide and reveal the truth. Jesus said, "When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth" (John 16:13).

### Tips for Bible Study

#### Ignore Later Additions

* Ignore title, chapter, and verse divisions as they did not exist in the original manuscripts.
* Ignore capital letters, quotes, and punctuation marks (or the lack thereof) as [these did not exist in the original manuscripts](https://blog.greek-language.com/2022/02/14/punctuation-in-ancient-greek-texts-part-i/).

#### Consider the Context

The original Bible authors did not write lookup books. They assumed readers would read the entire message from the beginning. When studying a passage, ask:

* **Who wrote the scripture?** (For example: an unknown author, a respected prophet, or an apostle?)
* **Who was the intended audience?** (For example: ancient Israelites, Romans, believers facing specific issues, non-believers receiving testimony?)
* **When was it written?** (Chronological order often explains why people behaved certain ways)
* **What was the culture?** (This explains "unusual" [idioms](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/idioms) or reactions)
* **Whose words are these?** (Some recorded arguments or accusations may contain false statements so we can learn from their errors)
* **Should this be understood literally?** (Usually yes, unless the context clearly indicates a poem, song, vision, prophecy, parable, metaphor, or idiom)

#### Understand Translation Choices

* Unlike the English word ["God"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god), the Greek and Hebrew equivalents can also mean an important person. Translators usually render this as "lord" when referring to a human, but there are cases where they incorrectly translated it to "God" when the Almighty God was not referenced. Context is crucial for determining which "god" is addressed.
* [God's identifying name was replaced with "Lord"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name) in most English Bibles. This can cause confusion since important humans or angelic beings are also called "lords." However, some translations use the uppercase "LORD" to mark this change.

#### Avoid Oversimplified Sources

* Avoid relying on ["bible" tales](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/tales) written to entertain children. These are often shortened and oversimplified versions that can be deceiving.

### Modern Study Tools

Today there are many modern interlinear Bible study tools available that provide word-by-word translations of the original Hebrew or Greek manuscripts. These can be used by anyone, regardless of theological background, to validate Bible text with concordances or gain a better understanding of passages.

## Your Next Steps

Now that you understand how to approach Bible study with proper context and tools, the question is: what will you do with this knowledge? Reading the Bible is not merely an academic exercise. It is meant to transform how you live.

Some cite 2 Peter 3:16 ("ignorant and unstable people distort [Paul's letters]") as a warning against studying Scripture alone. However, Peter is not condemning personal study. He's warning against **unstable** people who twist Scripture to fit their desires. The solution is not to avoid studying, but to study carefully using the principles above and comparing Scripture with Scripture.

Some may worry that individual Bible study leads to conflicting interpretations. However, disagreements often arise from ignoring the basic principles above. Reading out of context, imposing modern ideas onto ancient texts, or following traditions instead of Scripture creates confusion. When we let Scripture interpret itself and compare spiritual things with spiritual (1 Corinthians 2:13), the truth becomes clear.

As you begin your study journey, remember that the goal is not just to accumulate information, but to seek truth and allow God's Spirit to guide you into understanding. Will you commit to personal study rather than relying solely on others' interpretations? Will you approach Scripture with humility, acknowledging that some passages require careful examination of context, culture, and language?
