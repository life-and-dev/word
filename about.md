# About the Author

My faith journey has been unconventional: from atheism through various Christian traditions including megachurches, house churches, Protestant, charismatic, and Messianic congregations. Throughout these experiences, I've wrestled with fundamental questions: 

* Is the Bible truly God's Word? 
* How do we know which books belong in Scripture? 
* Which translations are faithful? 
* How do we address apparent contradictions?

## The Mission: Building Faith on Solid Ground

This website exists to help Christians answer a crucial question: **Which Bible scriptures are trustworthy?**

Like the Bereans who examined the scriptures carefully (Acts 17:11), I believe thoughtful investigation strengthens rather than weakens our faith. We're called to "test everything and hold fast to what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21) and to love God with all our minds (Matthew 22:37).

This careful examination isn't about doubting God's Word, but instead it's about building our faith on solid rock (Matthew 7:24-27).

## Independence & Transparency

I write independently, unaffiliated with any church or organization, without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's Word leads without institutional constraints.

I've been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll make mistakes again. That's why I invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you find them. Iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17), and your insights make this resource better for everyone.

## An Invitation to Examine

Don't accept my conclusions at face value. Instead, test everything against Scripture, ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom, and engage thoughtfully with challenging questions.

My prayer is that this site equips you to read the Bible with both greater confidence and greater discernmentâ€”knowing which scriptures are truly God's Word and building your faith on that unshakable foundation.

Together, let's explore what it means to be citizens of [God's Kingdom](https://kingdom.ofgod.info), faithful to [Christ](https://son.ofgod.info) our Lord, and grounded in trustworthy Scripture.
