# The Authorship of the Gospel of Matthew

The question of who wrote the Gospel of Matthew has been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries. While tradition attributes the book to the apostle Matthew, modern critical scholarship often suggests an anonymous author. This article explores the evidence supporting both views, examining early church testimony, internal literary features, and the methodologies that lead scholars to different conclusions.

The authorship of Matthew is debated between two main scholarly positions. The traditional view defends **apostolic authorship**, attributing the Gospel to the apostle Matthew. This position is primarily held by conservative scholars. In contrast, the majority critical view argues for **anonymous authorship**, suggesting the Gospel was written by an unknown figure. The core disagreement hinges on how to weight external testimony from the early church fathers against internal evidence like literary style, sources, and historical context.

## The Core Debate

The fundamental question is not simply "who wrote this?" but rather "what kind of evidence should determine authorship?" Scholars who trust early church tradition and allow for eyewitness use of written sources defend Matthean authorship. Scholars who prioritize literary analysis, source criticism, and historical contextualization conclude anonymous authorship. Each camp presents distinct evidence below.

## View 1: Traditional Apostolic Authorship (Conservative Scholarship)

**External Evidence from Early Church Fathers:**

[Papias of Hierapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis) (c. 60-130 CE), as preserved by [Eusebius of Caesarea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius) (*Ecclesiastical History* 3.39.16), provides one of the earliest testimonies:

> Matthew compiled the Oracles [*logia*] in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well as he could. — [Papias, via Eusebius](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm)

Conservative scholars interpret this as testimony that the apostle Matthew authored the Gospel, though he may have originally written in Aramaic/Hebrew and later disciples translated it to Greek.

[Irenaeus of Lyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) (c. 130-202 CE) provides a more explicit statement:

> Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome. — *Against Heresies* 3.1.1

Irenaeus, a link to the apostolic tradition through Polycarp, dates Matthew's composition to c. 60-67 CE (during Peter and Paul's Roman ministries). This represents the earliest explicit ascription of the Gospel to an apostle.

Later church fathers, like [Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome) (c. 342-420 CE) and [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) (c. 354-430 CE), affirm Matthew's authorship without question, representing centuries of unbroken tradition.

**Manuscript Tradition:**

All surviving Greek manuscripts bearing a superscription identify the Gospel as "According to Matthew" (κατὰ Μαθθαῖον). This universal attribution in the manuscript tradition reflects early church consensus about authorship.

**Arguments from Internal Evidence:**

1. **Jewish expertise**: The Gospel demonstrates detailed knowledge of Jewish customs, geography, Aramaic language (preserved phrases like "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?", Matthew 27:46), and Hebrew Scripture. This fits an apostle who was a Palestinian Jew.

2. **Financial interests**: Matthew emphasizes monetary details (Matthew 17:24-27 on temple tax, 18:23-35 on servant's debt, 20:1-16 on workers' wages) that plausibly reflect the background of a tax collector's familiarity with financial matters.

3. **The "Matthew" calling narrative** (Matthew 9:9): Unlike Mark and Luke, which call the disciple "Levi," Matthew names him "Matthew." Conservative scholars see this as the apostle's authorial identification, suggesting the author is presenting his own encounter with Jesus.

4. **Early attribution without competing tradition**: The church unanimously attributed Matthew to the apostle. No competing tradition claimed a different author, which would be expected if the attribution were fabricated.

**Modern Conservative Scholars:**

[Donald Hagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Hagner) (*Word Biblical Commentary on Matthew*), [R.T. France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._T._France) (*Tyndale New Testament Commentary*), [John MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._MacArthur), and evangelical scholars generally defend apostolic authorship, viewing Matthew as an apostle who used written sources (Mark, Q) while composing his Gospel.

**Conservative Harmonization of Problems:**

Even conservative scholars acknowledge Matthew used Mark as a source (approximately 90% overlap). They argue this is compatible with apostolic authorship: eyewitnesses could and did consult written sources when composing their own accounts. Peter could consult Mark's Gospel (traditionally Peter's assistant) when adding details from his apostolic memory.

## View 2: Anonymous Jewish-Christian Author (Majority Critical Scholarship)

**Literary Dependence on Mark:**

The majority of New Testament scholars (including those at major universities and seminaries) conclude that Matthew dependence on Mark (not the reverse) indicates non-eyewitness authorship. Matthew reproduces approximately 90% of Mark's content, often with stylistic improvements. Critical scholars argue: if Matthew were an eyewitness who had personally experienced these events, why would he need Mark as a source? An eyewitness would rely on memory, not on another's written account.

**Sophisticated Literary Composition:**

Matthew's five-fold discourse structure (paralleling the Pentateuch: Sermon on the Mount, Mission Discourse, Parables Discourse, Community Discourse, Eschatological Discourse) with formulaic conclusions ("when Jesus had finished these sayings," Matthew 7:28, 11:1, 13:53, 19:1, 26:1) suggests sophisticated literary architecture. This structured, polished Greek literary style indicates an educated scribe working decades after events, not a Galilean tax collector writing in the 60s CE.

**Community-Focused Concerns:**

Matthew contains extensive material addressing later Jewish-Christian community concerns:
- Conflict with "their synagogues" (Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 10:17, 12:9, 13:54) suggests separation from synagogue institutions
- Rules for church discipline and conflict resolution (Matthew 18:15-20)
- Tensions between Jewish law observance and Gentile inclusion (Matthew 5:17-20, 15:10-20, 28:19)

Critical scholars see these not as first-generation concerns (when Jesus' immediate disciples were still alive) but as second-generation issues (c. 80-95 CE) when Jewish-Christian communities were defining their identity apart from mainstream Judaism.

**Dating Evidence:**

Matthew appears to reflect knowledge of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. Matthew 22:7 states: "The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." The *past tense* ("destroyed...burned") indicates this is written *after* the historical event, not genuine prophecy. Additionally, Matthew 23 contains intensive polemics against Pharisaic Judaism, suggesting composition after the Yavneh Council (c. 85-90 CE) when Pharisaic Judaism reorganized under Johanan ben Zakkai and defined boundaries excluding Christians.

**The "Papias Problem":**

Critical scholars argue Papias likely refers not to our canonical Greek Matthew but to an earlier collection of Jesus' sayings (the hypothetical "Q" source or related material). The phrase "compiled the Oracles in the Hebrew language" may describe a sayings collection, not a full Gospel narrative. Papias may be passing along tradition without firsthand knowledge, and Eusebius' interpretation of Papias (written 200+ years later) may misrepresent the original testimony.

**Modern Critical Scholars:**

Major voices include:
- **[Ulrich Luz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_Luz)** (*Hermeneia Commentary*, major German scholar): argues for anonymous authorship, community context in Antioch c. 80-90 CE
- **[Douglas J. Moo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_J._Moo)** (*New Bible Commentary*, while more evangelical, acknowledges critical consensus)
- **[Craig S. Keener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_S._Keener)** (*IVP New Testament Commentary*): defends stronger case for apostolic authorship than many peers but acknowledges critical arguments' force
- **[Bart D. Ehrman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_D._Ehrman)** and most secular critical scholars: anonymous Jewish-Christian author
- **[Raymond E. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_E._Brown)** (*Introduction to the New Testament*, Catholic scholar): leans toward anonymous authorship while respecting conservative arguments

Critical scholars widely teach that Matthew should be attributed to "Matthew the evangelist" (anonymous) rather than "Matthew the apostle" to distinguish the tradition from established historical claims.

## Critiques of the Critical View

While the critical view is the consensus in modern scholarship, it faces several counter-arguments, often raised by those who defend traditional authorship:

1.  **Over-reliance on Hypothetical Sources:** The Two-Source Hypothesis, particularly the existence of the "Q" document, remains a theory. No manuscript of Q has ever been found. Critics argue that the consensus is built on a hypothetical foundation.
2.  **Assumptions about Ancient Literary Practices:** The argument that an eyewitness would not use a written source is an assumption based on modern sensibilities. Ancient authors, including historians who were eyewitnesses (like Thucydides), often incorporated other sources. Matthew might have used Mark for its narrative structure while adding his own eyewitness testimony and other traditions.
3.  **Dismissal of Early Church Testimony:** The unanimous testimony of early church fathers like Papias and Irenaeus is dismissed as unreliable. Critics of this view argue that these early writers were much closer in time and culture to the events and were in a better position to know the author's identity. Dismissing their testimony requires strong evidence, not just a preference for internal literary theories.
4.  **Philosophical Bias in Dating:** The argument for a late date based on Jesus' prediction of the temple's destruction (Matthew 24) assumes that genuine prophecy is impossible. If one allows for the possibility of predictive prophecy, the passage is not evidence for a post-70 CE date.

## View 3: Minority Positions Challenging Consensus

**Early Dating (40s-50s CE):**

[N.T. Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright) (Anglican theologian), John Wenham, and [John A. T. Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._T._Robinson) challenge the consensus dating. They argue:
- Evidence for Markan priority is not conclusive
- Matthew's "later concerns" actually reflect first-generation Jewish-Christian tensions
- The supposed "vaticinium ex eventu" (prophecy after the fact) in Matthew 24 may be genuine prediction
- Matthew could have been composed earlier, even if using Mark

This minority view preserves apostolic authorship while acknowledging source use.

**Matthean Priority:**

Some scholars (advocates of the Griesbach hypothesis) argue Mark used Matthew, not vice versa. If original, this would eliminate the primary argument against apostolic authorship. This view remains minority but has advocates among scholars like [William R. Farmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Reuben_Farmer) and Michael Goulder.

## Sources and Compositional Process

Nearly all scholars (conservative and critical) accept the **Two-Source Hypothesis**, which proposes that Matthew used two main sources: Mark's Gospel and "Q" (from the German *Quelle*, meaning "source"). "Q" is a hypothetical collection of Jesus' sayings that was also available to Luke, but not to Mark. Evidence: Matthew and Luke share approximately 235 verses not found in Mark, largely consisting of Jesus' teachings (Beatitudes, Lord's Prayer, various sayings).

**The "M" Material** (Matthew-only content): Matthew contains unique material not in other Gospels, including the infancy narrative (chapters 1-2), parables (the weeds, hidden treasure, pearl, net, unforgiving servant, workers in the vineyard, two sons, wedding feast, ten virgins, talents, sheep and goats judgment), and portions of the Sermon on the Mount. Whether this represents:
- Written sources Matthew accessed (conservative view)
- Oral traditions from Matthean community memory (critical view)
- The author's own composition (either view possible)

...remains debated.

## Methodological Divide

The authorship debate ultimately reflects **competing methodologies**:

**Conservative Methodology:**
- Weight early church tradition heavily (assumed to have reliable apostolic knowledge)
- Allow eyewitnesses to use written sources without requiring firsthand memory
- Interpret "later concerns" as first-generation issues
- Assume authorship attributed universally was likely reliable
- View linguistic/stylistic differences as reflecting copyists, translators, or deliberate literary choices, not necessarily different authors

**Critical Methodology:**
- Prioritize internal literary evidence over external tradition (which may reflect pious later invention)
- Assume eyewitness authorship would minimize source dependence
- Date Gospel composition based on historical concerns and literary development
- Recognize that uniform early attribution could result from scribal tradition, association with source material, or pious convention
- Use source criticism and redaction criticism to identify authorial layers and community concerns

## Conclusion

The authorship of the Gospel of Matthew remains a topic of vigorous scholarly discussion, fundamentally split by different [methodological approaches](#methodological-divide). Proponents of [traditional apostolic authorship](#view-1-traditional-apostolic-authorship-conservative-scholarship) argue that the apostle Matthew wrote the Gospel, a view supported by the testimony of early church fathers and certain internal literary features. In contrast, the majority of critical scholars propose an [anonymous author](#view-2-anonymous-jewish-christian-author-majority-critical-scholarship), citing the Gospel's literary dependence on Mark and its focus on later community concerns. The debate is further shaped by the widespread acceptance of the [Two-Source Hypothesis](#sources-and-compositional-process), which examines how the author may have used sources like Mark and Q. While the identity of the author remains debated, the Gospel's authority and its role as a key witness to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ are acknowledged across the scholarly spectrum.
