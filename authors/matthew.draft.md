# The Authorship of the Gospel of Matthew

Matthew's authorship involves two competing scholarly views: **traditional apostolic authorship** (defended by conservative scholars) versus **anonymous authorship** (majority critical view). The core disagreement hinges on how to weight external testimony (early church fathers) against internal evidence (literary style, sources, historical concerns).

### The Core Debate

The fundamental question is not simply "who wrote this?" but rather "what kind of evidence should determine authorship?" Scholars who trust early church tradition and allow for eyewitness use of written sources defend Matthean authorship. Scholars who prioritize literary analysis, source criticism, and historical contextualization conclude anonymous authorship. Each camp presents distinct evidence below.

### View 1: Traditional Apostolic Authorship (Conservative Scholarship)

**External Evidence from Early Church Fathers:**

Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60-130 CE), preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea (*Ecclesiastical History* 3.39.16), states: "Matthew compiled the Oracles [*logia*] in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well as he could." Conservative scholars interpret this as testimony that the apostle Matthew authored the Gospel, though he may have originally written in Aramaic/Hebrew and later disciples translated it to Greek.

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 CE, *Against Heresies* 3.1.1) explicitly states: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome." Irenaeus, a link to the apostolic tradition through Polycarp, dates Matthew's composition to c. 60-67 CE (during Peter and Paul's Roman ministries). This represents the earliest explicit ascription of the Gospel to an apostle.

Jerome (c. 342-420 CE) and Augustine (c. 354-430 CE), later church fathers, affirm Matthew's authorship without question, representing centuries of unbroken tradition.

**Manuscript Tradition:**

All surviving Greek manuscripts bearing a superscription identify the Gospel as "According to Matthew" (κατὰ Μαθθαῖον). This universal attribution in the manuscript tradition reflects early church consensus about authorship.

**Arguments from Internal Evidence:**

1. **Jewish expertise**: The Gospel demonstrates detailed knowledge of Jewish customs, geography, Aramaic language (preserved phrases like "Talitha koum," Matthew 27:46), and Hebrew Scripture. This fits an apostle who was a Palestinian Jew.

2. **Financial interests**: Matthew emphasizes monetary details (Matthew 17:24-27 on temple tax, 18:23-35 on servant's debt, 20:1-16 on workers' wages) that plausibly reflect the background of a tax collector's familiarity with financial matters.

3. **The "Matthew" calling narrative** (Matthew 9:9): Unlike Mark and Luke, which call the disciple "Levi," Matthew names him "Matthew." Conservative scholars see this as the apostle's authorial identification, suggesting the author is presenting his own encounter with Jesus.

4. **Early attribution without competing tradition**: The church unanimously attributed Matthew to the apostle—no competing tradition claimed a different author, which would be expected if the attribution were fabricated.

**Modern Conservative Scholars:**

Donald Hagner (*Word Biblical Commentary on Matthew*), R.T. France (*Tyndale New Testament Commentary*), John MacArthur, and evangelical scholars generally defend apostolic authorship, viewing Matthew as an apostle who used written sources (Mark, Q) while composing his Gospel.

**Conservative Harmonization of Problems:**

Even conservative scholars acknowledge Matthew used Mark as a source (approximately 90% overlap). They argue this is compatible with apostolic authorship: eyewitnesses could and did consult written sources when composing their own accounts. Peter could consult Mark's Gospel (traditionally Peter's assistant) when adding details from his apostolic memory.

### View 2: Anonymous Jewish-Christian Author (Majority Critical Scholarship)

**Literary Dependence on Mark:**

The majority of New Testament scholars (including those at major universities and seminaries) conclude that Matthew dependence on Mark (not the reverse) indicates non-eyewitness authorship. Matthew reproduces approximately 90% of Mark's content, often with stylistic improvements. Critical scholars argue: if Matthew were an eyewitness who had personally experienced these events, why would he need Mark as a source? An eyewitness would rely on memory, not on another's written account.

**Sophisticated Literary Composition:**

Matthew's five-fold discourse structure (paralleling the Pentateuch: Sermon on the Mount, Mission Discourse, Parables Discourse, Community Discourse, Eschatological Discourse) with formulaic conclusions ("when Jesus had finished these sayings," Matthew 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1) suggests sophisticated literary architecture. This structured, polished Greek literary style indicates an educated scribe working decades after events, not a Galilean tax collector writing in the 60s CE.

**Community-Focused Concerns:**

Matthew contains extensive material addressing later Jewish-Christian community concerns:
- Conflict with "their synagogues" (Matthew 4:23; 9:35; 10:17; 12:9; 13:54) suggests separation from synagogue institutions
- Rules for church discipline and conflict resolution (Matthew 18:15-20)
- Tensions between Jewish law observance and Gentile inclusion (Matthew 5:17-20; 15:10-20; 28:19)

Critical scholars see these not as first-generation concerns (when Jesus' immediate disciples were still alive) but as second-generation issues (c. 80-95 CE) when Jewish-Christian communities were defining their identity apart from mainstream Judaism.

**Dating Evidence:**

Matthew appears to reflect knowledge of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. Matthew 22:7 states: "The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." The *past tense* ("destroyed...burned") indicates this is written *after* the historical event, not genuine prophecy. Additionally, Matthew 23 contains intensive polemics against Pharisaic Judaism, suggesting composition after the Yavneh Council (c. 85-90 CE) when Pharisaic Judaism reorganized under Johanan ben Zakkai and defined boundaries excluding Christians.

**The "Papias Problem":**

Critical scholars argue Papias likely refers not to our canonical Greek Matthew but to an earlier collection of Jesus' sayings (the hypothetical "Q" source or related material). The phrase "compiled the Oracles in the Hebrew language" may describe a sayings collection, not a full Gospel narrative. Papias may be passing along tradition without firsthand knowledge, and Eusebius' interpretation of Papias (written 200+ years later) may misrepresent the original testimony.

**Modern Critical Scholars:**

Major voices include:
- **Ulrich Luz** (*Hermeneia Commentary*, major German scholar): argues for anonymous authorship, community context in Antioch c. 80-90 CE
- **Douglas Moo** (*New Bible Commentary*, while more evangelical, acknowledges critical consensus)
- **David Keener** (*IVP New Testament Commentary*): defends stronger case for apostolic authorship than many peers but acknowledges critical arguments' force
- **Bart Ehrman** and most secular critical scholars: anonymous Jewish-Christian author
- **Raymond Brown** (*Introduction to the New Testament*, Catholic scholar): leans toward anonymous authorship while respecting conservative arguments

Critical scholars widely teach that Matthew should be attributed to "Matthew the evangelist" (anonymous) rather than "Matthew the apostle" to distinguish the tradition from established historical claims.

### View 3: Minority Positions Challenging Consensus

**Early Dating (40s-50s CE):**

N.T. Wright (Anglican theologian), John Wenham, and John A.T. Robinson challenge the consensus dating. They argue:
- Evidence for Markan priority is not conclusive
- Matthew's "later concerns" actually reflect first-generation Jewish-Christian tensions
- The supposed "vaticinium ex eventu" (prophecy after the fact) in Matthew 24 may be genuine prediction
- Matthew could have been composed earlier, even if using Mark

This minority view preserves apostolic authorship while acknowledging source use.

**Matthean Priority:**

Some scholars (advocates of the Griesbach hypothesis) argue Mark used Matthew, not vice versa. If original, this would eliminate the primary argument against apostolic authorship. This view remains minority but has advocates among scholars like William Farmer and Michael Goulder.

### Sources and Compositional Process

Nearly all scholars (conservative and critical) accept the **Two-Source Hypothesis**: Matthew used (1) Mark's Gospel and (2) "Q" (German *Quelle*, "source")—a hypothetical sayings collection shared with Luke but absent from Mark. Evidence: Matthew and Luke share approximately 235 verses not found in Mark, largely consisting of Jesus' teachings (Beatitudes, Lord's Prayer, various sayings).

**The "M" Material** (Matthew-only content): Matthew contains unique material not in other Gospels, including the infancy narrative (chapters 1-2), parables (the weeds, hidden treasure, pearl, net, unforgiving servant, workers in the vineyard, two sons, wedding feast, ten virgins, talents, sheep and goats judgment), and portions of the Sermon on the Mount. Whether this represents:
- Written sources Matthew accessed (conservative view)
- Oral traditions from Matthean community memory (critical view)
- The author's own composition (either view possible)

...remains debated.

### Methodological Divide

The authorship debate ultimately reflects **competing methodologies**:

**Conservative Methodology:**
- Weight early church tradition heavily (assumed to have reliable apostolic knowledge)
- Allow eyewitnesses to use written sources without requiring firsthand memory
- Interpret "later concerns" as first-generation issues
- Assume authorship attributed universally was likely reliable
- View linguistic/stylistic differences as reflecting copyists, translators, or deliberate literary choices, not necessarily different authors

**Critical Methodology:**
- Prioritize internal literary evidence over external tradition (which may reflect pious later invention)
- Assume eyewitness authorship would minimize source dependence
- Date Gospel composition based on historical concerns and literary development
- Recognize that uniform early attribution could result from scribal tradition, association with source material, or pious convention
- Use source criticism and redaction criticism to identify authorial layers and community concerns

### Conclusion

The question of Matthew's authorship divides scholars along epistemological lines: whether early church tradition or modern literary analysis should carry greater weight. Conservative scholarship maintains that apostolic Matthew composed the Gospel (possibly originally in Aramaic), later translated and augmented by disciples. Critical scholarship concludes an anonymous Jewish-Christian community scribe wrote Matthew (c. 80-95 CE) using Mark, Q, and community traditions for a Jewish-Christian congregation defining its identity.

Both traditions recognize the Gospel's canonical authority and affirm its presentation as apostolic testimony about Jesus Christ. Whether through direct composition by Matthew, superintendence of a scribe by Matthew, or preservation of Matthew's testimony through tradition, the early church's universal attribution preserves the conviction that this Gospel authentically represents the apostle Matthew's witness to Jesus as the Messiah.
