# The Authorship of the Gospel of Matthew

For nearly two millennia, the Gospel of Matthew has held a place of prominence as the first book of the New Testament. Tradition has long attributed it to Matthew, the tax collector who became one of Jesus's twelve apostles. However, modern scholarship has raised questions about this long-standing view, uncovering clues within the text that point toward a different author. This article delves into this historical mystery, exploring the evidence for both the traditional and alternative views. It examines the testimony of the early church, the Gospel's literary clues, and the scholarly methods used to navigate one of the most significant questions in biblical studies.

The debate over Matthew's authorship involves two primary scholarly views: traditional apostolic authorship, defended by conservative scholars, and anonymous authorship, which is the majority view in critical scholarship. The core disagreement hinges on how to weigh external testimony from early church fathers against internal evidence from the text's literary style, sources, and historical context.

## The Core Debate

The fundamental question is not simply "who wrote this?" but rather "what kind of evidence should determine authorship?" Scholars who trust early church tradition and allow for an eyewitness to use written sources tend to defend Matthean authorship. In contrast, scholars who prioritize literary analysis, source criticism, and historical contextualization often conclude the author was anonymous. Each perspective relies on distinct forms of evidence.

## Traditional View: The Apostle Matthew

**External Evidence from Early Church Fathers:**

Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60-130 CE), in a statement preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea (*Ecclesiastical History* 3.39.16), says: "Matthew compiled the Oracles [*logia*] in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well as he could." Conservative scholars interpret this as testimony that the apostle Matthew authored the Gospel. They believe he may have originally written in Aramaic or Hebrew, with his disciples later translating it into Greek.

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 CE, *Against Heresies* 3.1.1) explicitly states: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome." Irenaeus, who was linked to the apostolic tradition through Polycarp, dates Matthew's composition to approximately 60–67 CE. This represents the earliest explicit ascription of the Gospel to an apostle.

Later church fathers, such as Jerome (c. 342-420 CE) and Augustine (c. 354-430 CE), affirmed Matthew's authorship without question, representing centuries of unbroken tradition.

**Manuscript Tradition:**

All surviving Greek manuscripts that include a title identify the Gospel as "According to Matthew" (κατὰ Μαθθαῖον). This universal attribution reflects an early church consensus about its authorship.

**Arguments from Internal Evidence:**

1.  **Jewish Expertise**: The Gospel demonstrates detailed knowledge of Jewish customs, geography, Hebrew Scripture, and Aramaic phrases (such as "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" in Matthew 27:46). This profile fits an apostle who was a Palestinian Jew.

2.  **Financial Interests**: The Gospel emphasizes monetary details, such as the temple tax in Matthew 17:24-27, the servant's debt in 18:23-35, and the workers' wages in 20:1-16. This focus could plausibly reflect the background of a tax collector familiar with financial matters.

3.  **The "Matthew" Calling Narrative**: In Matthew 9:9, the author names the called disciple "Matthew," unlike Mark and Luke, which refer to him as "Levi." Conservative scholars see this as the apostle's authorial identification, suggesting the author is presenting his own encounter with Jesus.

4.  **Early Attribution Without Competing Tradition**: The church unanimously attributed the Gospel to the apostle Matthew. No competing tradition claimed a different author, which would be expected if the attribution were fabricated.

**Modern Conservative Scholars:**

Donald Hagner (*Word Biblical Commentary on Matthew*), R.T. France (*Tyndale New Testament Commentary*), and John MacArthur are among the evangelical scholars who defend apostolic authorship. They generally view Matthew as an apostle who used written sources, including Mark and Q, while composing his Gospel.

**Conservative Harmonization of Problems:**

Even conservative scholars acknowledge that Matthew used Mark as a source, with approximately 90% overlap between the two Gospels. They argue this is compatible with apostolic authorship, as eyewitnesses could and did consult written sources when composing their own accounts.

## Critical View: An Anonymous Author

**Literary Dependence on Mark:**

The majority of New Testament scholars conclude that Matthew's dependence on Mark indicates non-eyewitness authorship. Matthew reproduces approximately 90% of Mark's content, often with stylistic improvements. Critical scholars argue that an eyewitness who had personally experienced these events would not need to rely so heavily on another's written account.

**Sophisticated Literary Composition:**

Matthew's five-fold discourse structure, which parallels the Pentateuch, suggests a sophisticated literary architecture. This structured and polished Greek literary style indicates an educated scribe working decades after the events, not a Galilean tax collector writing in the 60s CE.

**Community-Focused Concerns:**

Matthew contains extensive material addressing later Jewish-Christian community concerns, such as conflict with "their synagogues" (Matthew 4:23, 9:35), rules for church discipline (Matthew 18:15-20), and tensions between Jewish law and Gentile inclusion (Matthew 28:19). Critical scholars see these as second-generation issues (c. 80–95 CE), arising when Jewish-Christian communities were defining their identity apart from mainstream Judaism.

**Dating Evidence:**

Matthew appears to reflect knowledge of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. Matthew 22:7 states: "The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." The use of the past tense suggests this was written after the event. Additionally, Matthew 23 contains intensive polemics against Pharisaic Judaism, possibly reflecting a composition date after the Council of Yavneh (c. 85–90 CE), when Pharisaic Judaism reorganized and formally excluded Christians.

**The "Papias Problem":**

Critical scholars argue that Papias likely referred not to our canonical Greek Matthew but to an earlier collection of Jesus's sayings, such as the hypothetical "Q" source. The phrase "compiled the Oracles in the Hebrew language" may describe a sayings collection, not a full Gospel narrative.

**Modern Critical Scholars:**

Major voices in this camp include Ulrich Luz, Douglas Moo, and Raymond Brown. Secular critical scholars like Bart Ehrman also support the view of an anonymous Jewish-Christian author. These scholars widely teach that the Gospel should be attributed to "Matthew the evangelist" (anonymous) rather than "Matthew the apostle" to distinguish the tradition from established historical claims.

## Critiques of the Traditional View

While the traditional view is supported by early church testimony, it faces several significant challenges from a critical perspective:

1.  **The Anonymous Nature of the Gospels:** All four canonical Gospels were originally anonymous. The titles "According to Matthew," "According to Mark," and so on, were added in the second century, likely to give the texts apostolic authority. This suggests that the early church may not have had a clear tradition of authorship.

2.  **Sophisticated Greek and Literary Structure:** The Gospel is written in a polished, literary Greek, which would be unexpected for a Galilean tax collector whose native language was Aramaic. The author also demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of literary techniques and narrative structure, suggesting a level of education and training not typically associated with the apostle Matthew.

3.  **Use of Sources:** The strong dependence on Mark's Gospel raises questions about eyewitness authorship. If the author were an eyewitness, it is unclear why he would need to rely so heavily on a non-eyewitness account for the basic narrative of Jesus's ministry.

4.  **Lack of First-Person Narrative:** The author never claims to be an eyewitness or uses the first person ("I" or "we") to describe events. This is in contrast to other ancient historical works where eyewitness authors would often identify themselves.

## Critiques of the Critical View

While the critical view is the consensus in modern scholarship, it faces several counter-arguments:

1.  **Over-reliance on Hypothetical Sources:** The Two-Source Hypothesis, particularly the existence of the "Q" document, remains a theory, as no manuscript of Q has ever been found. Critics argue that the consensus is built on a hypothetical foundation.
2.  **Assumptions about Ancient Literary Practices:** The argument that an eyewitness would not use a written source is an assumption based on modern sensibilities. Ancient authors, including historians who were eyewitnesses like Thucydides, often incorporated other sources.
3.  **Dismissal of Early Church Testimony:** The unanimous testimony of early church fathers like Papias and Irenaeus is dismissed as unreliable. Critics of this view argue that these writers were closer in time and culture to the events and were in a better position to know the author's identity.
4.  **Philosophical Bias in Dating:** The argument for a late date based on Jesus's prediction of the temple's destruction assumes that genuine prophecy is impossible. If one allows for the possibility of predictive prophecy, the passage does not require a post-70 CE date.

## Minority Views

**Early Dating (40s–50s CE):**

N.T. Wright, John Wenham, and John A.T. Robinson have challenged the consensus dating, arguing that the evidence for Markan priority is not conclusive and that Matthew's "later concerns" could reflect first-generation Jewish-Christian tensions. This minority view preserves apostolic authorship while acknowledging the use of sources.

**Matthean Priority:**

Some scholars, who advocate for the Griesbach hypothesis, argue that Mark used Matthew, not the reverse. If this were the case, it would eliminate the primary argument against apostolic authorship. This view remains a minority position but has advocates such as William Farmer and Michael Goulder.

## Sources and Compositional Process

Nearly all scholars accept the **Two-Source Hypothesis**, which proposes that Matthew used two main sources: Mark's Gospel and "Q" (from the German *Quelle*, meaning "source"). "Q" is a hypothetical collection of Jesus's sayings that was also available to Luke. This is supported by the approximately 235 verses that Matthew and Luke share but are not found in Mark.

**The "M" Material**: Matthew also contains unique material not found in other Gospels, including parts of the infancy narrative, several parables, and portions of the Sermon on the. Whether this material comes from other written sources, oral traditions, or the author's own composition remains debated.

## Methodological Divide

The authorship debate ultimately reflects **competing methodologies**:

**Conservative Methodology:**
-  Weights early church tradition heavily.
-  Allows for eyewitnesses to use written sources.
-  Interprets "later concerns" as first-generation issues.
-  Assumes that a universally attributed authorship was likely reliable.

**Critical Methodology:**
-  Prioritizes internal literary evidence over external tradition.
-  Assumes eyewitness authorship would minimize source dependence.
-  Dates Gospel composition based on historical concerns and literary development.
-  Recognizes that uniform attribution could result from scribal tradition or pious convention.

## Conclusion

The authorship of the Gospel of Matthew remains a topic of vigorous scholarly discussion, fundamentally split by different [methodological approaches](#methodological-divide). Proponents of the [traditional view](#traditional-view-the-apostle-matthew) argue that the apostle Matthew wrote the Gospel, a position supported by the testimony of early church fathers and certain internal literary features. In contrast, the majority of critical scholars propose an [anonymous author](#critical-view-an-anonymous-author), citing the Gospel's literary dependence on Mark and its focus on later community concerns. The debate is further shaped by the widespread acceptance of the [Two-Source Hypothesis](#sources-and-compositional-process), which examines how the author may have used sources like Mark and Q. While the identity of the author remains debated, the Gospel's authority and its role as a key witness to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ are acknowledged across the scholarly spectrum.
