# How to edit this content

## Create a GitHub account
1. Open https://github.com/join
2. Choose username, email, password, verify captcha, follow email verification link.

## Fork the repo
This will make a copy of the project repository under your own account.
1. Go to https://github.com/life-and-dev/word (while signed in).
2. Click the "Fork" button (top-right). Wait for the fork to finish; you'll be taken to your copy at `github.com/<your-username>/word`.
3. Do not edit main branch directly. Instead, create a feature branch for your edits with a short descriptive branch name, e.g. fix-readme or edit-content.  
4. Edit the markdown content directly on your GitHub branch or optionally edit the content offline on your own local machine with a [local Git clone of your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
5. When done with the editing, you may stage and commit your changes in your feature branch.
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork to the original repo (life-and-dev/word).
7. After pushing, GitHub usually shows a “Compare & pull request” button — click it. Or go to the original repo (life-and-dev/word) → Pull requests → New pull request → choose “compare across forks” and select your fork and branch as the head.
8. Fill the PR title and description describing what you changed and why.
9. Confirm the base repo is life-and-dev/word (base: main) and the compare is your fork/branch.
10. Click “Create pull request.”

This will notify the author of this website that there are pending changes. The author may reach out to you via your Github account if the author has any questions regarding the requested changes.

Once approved, your changes will automatically be published online.

## How to suggestion changes
If you do not feel comfortable to edit the changes directly yourself, you may open an "Issue" on GitHub with the suggestion that you would like to make.
