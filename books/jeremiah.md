# Jeremiah

## Authorship

The Book of Jeremiah's authorship is one of the most complex in the Hebrew Bible. While centered on the prophet Jeremiah, scholarly consensus recognizes the book as the product of multiple authors and editors over a long period.

The traditional view, based on passages like Jeremiah 36:4, attributes the prophecies to Jeremiah, who dictated them to his scribe, [Baruch ben Neriah](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Baruch-biblical-figure). Baruch is often credited with the biographical narratives, a view supported by ancient Jewish tradition (Talmud, Bava Batra 15a).

Modern scholarship identifies several compositional layers. The process likely began with Jeremiah's own oracles (primarily in chapters 1–25), which were supplemented by biographical material from an eyewitness like Baruch. A significant layer of editing occurred during and after the Babylonian exile by authors from the [Deuteronomistic school](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deuteronomist), who interpreted Jeremiah's message for the exiled community.

This complex history is evidenced by two ancient versions of the book. The [Septuagint (LXX)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint) (Greek translation) is about one-eighth shorter and arranges material differently than the traditional Hebrew [Masoretic Text (MT)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Masoretic-text). The discovery of Hebrew manuscripts of both versions at Qumran confirms that two distinct editions circulated in the Second Temple period, revealing a dynamic process of composition where prophetic inspiration was preserved alongside communal reflection.

## Historical Environment

Jeremiah prophesied from approximately 627 to 586 BCE, a period of intense geopolitical turmoil that saw the fall of Judah. His ministry coincided with the decline of the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire) and the rise of the [Neo-Babylonian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Babylonian_Empire), which became the dominant regional power after its victory over Egypt at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE.

Jeremiah's work spanned the reigns of Judah's last five kings. He began his ministry under the righteous King Josiah but saw his reforms undone by his successors. Jeremiah fiercely denounced the apostasy and oppression of kings like [Jehoiakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehoiakim), who famously burned the prophet's scroll. During the reign of Judah's final king, Zedekiah, Jeremiah's unpopular message was to submit to Babylon, which he proclaimed as God's instrument of judgment. This counsel was viewed as treason, leading to his persecution.

Zedekiah's eventual rebellion against Babylon led to the catastrophic [Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(587_BC)). In 586 BCE, the Babylonians destroyed the city and Solomon's Temple, blinding and capturing Zedekiah and exiling most of the population. After the fall, the appointed governor Gedaliah was assassinated, and the remaining Judeans fled to Egypt, forcing the elderly Jeremiah to accompany them. His prophecies, delivered amidst national collapse, framed the disaster as divine judgment for covenant unfaithfulness while offering hope for future restoration.

## Purpose

The Book of Jeremiah serves several interconnected purposes, primarily as an urgent call to repentance for the nation of Judah. From the start, Jeremiah's mission was to warn of imminent judgment from Babylon unless the people turned from idolatry and social injustice. He systematically documented Judah's sins to explain *why* this judgment was not only justified but inevitable, vindicating God's righteousness when the catastrophe occurred.

A key function of Jeremiah's ministry was to counter the false prophets who offered deceptive messages of peace. He confronted their dangerous theology, famously declaring the Temple would offer no magical protection if the people's hearts were corrupt. Once judgment was certain, Jeremiah's purpose shifted to counseling submission to Babylon. This deeply unpopular message, framed as yielding to God's sovereign will, was intended to preserve life and minimize suffering.

Despite the overwhelming theme of judgment, the book's purpose is also to sustain hope. The "Book of Consolation" (chapters 30-33) contains some of the Bible's most profound promises of restoration, including the New Covenant (31:31-34), where God promises to transform human hearts from within. This highlights one of Jeremiah's unique teachings: genuine repentance is impossible through human effort alone. The human heart is "deceitful above all things" (17:9), and requires divine intervention. Jeremiah's prophetic act of purchasing a field during the siege of Jerusalem served as a powerful sign that God would one day restore the people to their land.

For the exilic community and later readers, the book provides a theological framework for understanding national trauma, demonstrating that God had not abandoned His people but was faithfully executing covenant justice. It teaches about God's sovereignty over all nations and reveals a God who grieves over the necessity of judgment. Ultimately, Jeremiah's overarching purpose is to encourage faithfulness through crisis, assuring God's people that judgment is not the final word and that restoration is possible through His gracious initiative.

## Canonical Status

The Book of Jeremiah holds an undisputed place in the biblical canon for both Jews and Christians. In the Hebrew Bible, it is a key part of the Latter Prophets. Its authority was recognized early, as evidenced by its use in the book of Daniel, its mention by Ben Sira (c. 180 BCE), and the discovery of multiple copies among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Christianity inherited Jeremiah as sacred scripture, and its canonical status was universally affirmed by early church fathers and councils.

A notable feature is the existence of two ancient versions: the longer Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) and a shorter Greek version (the Septuagint or LXX). The Dead Sea Scrolls confirm that both text types circulated in antiquity. Despite these significant textual differences, Jeremiah's prophetic authority and historical importance ensured it was never seriously challenged for inclusion in the canon. It remains a foundational text in all major Jewish and Christian traditions.

## Textual Variants

The Book of Jeremiah is unique because it has come down to us in two substantially different ancient forms:

*   The **Masoretic Text (MT)**, which is the standard Hebrew Bible and the basis for most modern English translations.
*   The **Septuagint (LXX)**, which is the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.

The most significant difference is length: the LXX version is about one-eighth shorter than the MT. It lacks about 2,700 words found in the longer MT. The arrangement of the text also differs, most notably the oracles against foreign nations (chapters 46-51 in the MT) are placed in the middle of the book in the LXX and in a different order.

### Which Version is Earlier?

For centuries, scholars debated which version was more "original." The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls provided a breakthrough. Manuscripts found at Qumran included Hebrew copies corresponding to *both* the longer MT and the shorter LXX text types. This confirmed that two different Hebrew editions of Jeremiah were circulating during the Second Temple period. 

Today, the scholarly consensus is that the **shorter text, represented by the LXX, is the earlier edition**. The **longer Masoretic Text (MT) is seen as a later edition** that was expanded over time with additional material and clarifications. Therefore, while **most Bibles are based on the longer MT**, the shorter LXX likely gives us a glimpse into an earlier stage of Jeremiah's composition.

## Summary

The Book of Jeremiah spans 52 chapters, presenting God's message through one of Israel's most significant prophets during the nation's darkest hour. Jeremiah presents consistent divine themes:

- God's holiness and justice require judgment of persistent rebellion
- God grieves over judgment but cannot compromise His righteousness
- Repentance must come from the heart, requiring divine transformation
- God remains faithful to His covenant even in judgment
- Ultimate restoration is certain because of God's unchanging love
- True faith trusts God even when His ways are painful

Jeremiah's ministry demonstrates that genuine prophecy often brings suffering, that institutional religion without justice is worthless, and that God's purposes will prevail despite human resistance.

### The Prophet's Commission and Judah's Indictment
*(Jeremiah 1-10)*

The book opens with God's direct and personal call to Jeremiah: **"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you... I appointed you a prophet to the nations"** (1:5). God touches Jeremiah's mouth, declaring, **"Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. See, I have set you this day over nations... to pluck up and to break down... to build and to plant"** (1:9-10).

Immediately, God lays out His case against Judah, summarizing their sin as **"two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water"** (2:13). The indictment is not for mere ritual failure but for a deep-seated betrayal of the covenant. God's judgment is announced as an invasion from "a foe from the north," but it is paired with a plea for genuine repentance: **"Circumcise yourselves to the Lord; remove the foreskin of your hearts"** (4:4). At the temple gate, Jeremiah delivers God's scathing Temple Sermon, warning the people not to trust in the temple as a magical charm. God declares their worship hypocritical, asking, **"Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?"** (7:11). He threatens to destroy it just as He had destroyed Shiloh.

### Sovereignty, Laments, and a Point of No Return
*(Jeremiah 11-29)*

God reveals to Jeremiah that the people have broken the covenant and are plotting against his life. Through a visit to a potter's house, God illustrates His sovereignty: just as the potter can reshape a marred vessel, God can relent from disaster if the nation repents (18:1-11). However, the people's continued rebellion leads to Jeremiah's persecution and his famous lament where he accuses God of deceiving him, yet finds the divine word to be a **"burning fire shut up in my bones"** (20:9).

The tone shifts as judgment becomes inevitable. God rejects Jeremiah's intercession, stating, **"Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people"** (15:1). He confronts false prophets who offer empty promises of peace and, through a letter to those already exiled in 597 BCE, commands them to **"seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile"** (29:7). It is here God gives the famous prophecy that the exile will last for seventy years, after which He will restore them (25:11, 29:10).

*Other MT Passages Absent from the LXX: In addition to its shorter length overall, the LXX notably lacks several specific passages found in the MT within this portion of the book. These include a doxology praising God (10:6-8, 10), descriptions of Judah's ingrained sin (17:1-4), and a harsh oracle against the king and people who remained in Jerusalem (29:16-20).*

### The Book of Consolation and the New Covenant
*(Jeremiah 30-33)*

Amidst the gloom, chapters 30-33 contain God's most profound promises of hope. This section, known as the "Book of Consolation," reaches its zenith with the promise of a New Covenant. God declares: **"I will make a new covenant... not like the covenant that I made with their fathers... I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be their people"** (31:31-33). This new relationship will be characterized by radical forgiveness and direct, internal knowledge of God. As a tangible sign of this future restoration, God commands the imprisoned Jeremiah to buy a field, declaring that **"houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land"** (32:15).

*The MT includes an additional significant passage of hope absent from the LXX, where God explicitly reaffirms His covenant with David's royal line, promising that a "righteous Branch" will reign and that this covenant is as permanent as the cycles of day and night (33:14-26).*

### The Fall of Jerusalem and Aftermath
*(Jeremiah 34-45)*

As the Babylonian siege intensifies, Jeremiah's warnings are ignored. King Jehoiakim burns the prophet's scroll, and King Zedekiah refuses the final offer of surrender. Consequently, Jerusalem falls in 586 BCE. The MT provides a more detailed account of the fall than the LXX, including Nebuchadnezzar's specific orders to protect Jeremiah (39:4-13). After the city's destruction, the remaining Judeans assassinate the Babylonian-appointed governor, and against God's explicit command to remain in the land, they flee to Egypt, forcing Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch to go with them. There, Jeremiah delivers his final prophecies, warning that judgment will follow them.

### Oracles and Appendices
*(Jeremiah 46-52)*

The book concludes with a series of oracles proclaiming God's judgment on the surrounding nations, including Egypt, Philistia, and Moab. The longest oracle is reserved for Babylon, which, despite being God's instrument of judgment, is condemned for its pride and promised utter destruction. A major structural difference between the two versions occurs here: these oracles appear at the end of the book in the MT (chs. 46-51) but are placed in the middle (after 25:13) and in a different order in the LXX.

Finally, chapter 52, which is absent from the LXX, serves as a historical appendix. It recounts the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple, largely duplicating material from 2 Kings 24-25, and ends on a faint note of hope with the release of King Jehoiachin from his Babylonian prison.

*Other MT Passages Absent from the LXX: Beyond the major structural differences, the LXX also lacks more detailed accounts of the fall of Jerusalem (e.g., 39:4-13), parts of the oracle against Moab (48:45-47), and a specific tally of the number of exiles (52:27b-30).*

## Unique Teachings

Jeremiah contains several theological teachings that are either unique to this book or presented with distinctive clarity and emphasis. These contributions profoundly shaped both Jewish and Christian theology.

### The New Covenant

Jeremiah's most significant unique contribution is the promise of a New Covenant in Jeremiah 31:31-34. This is the only Old Testament passage where the term "new covenant" appears.

**What Makes It Unique:**

- **Internalization:** The law will be written on hearts, not external tablets
- **Direct Knowledge:** No longer will teaching be necessary—everyone will know God personally
- **Complete Forgiveness:** God will remember sin no more
- **Divine Initiative:** God Himself transforms hearts rather than demanding human effort

This teaching revolutionized understanding of salvation and became foundational for Christian theology (quoted extensively in Hebrews 8 and 10).

**Jewish vs. Christian Interpretation:**

While Jews accept Jeremiah's New Covenant prophecy as authentic scripture, they interpret it very differently than Christians:

- **Jewish View**: The passage is understood as unfulfilled prophecy awaiting the Messianic Age. The new covenant will restore Israel nationally, with the law "written on hearts" meaning *deepened devotion* to the existing Torah (not its replacement).

- **Christian View**: Christians interpret the New Covenant as fulfilled in Jesus Christ, with the "law written on hearts" accomplished through the Holy Spirit's work and that the New Covenant *supersedes* the Mosaic covenant which forms the foundation of Christian faith.

**Key Differences:**

The Jewish interpretation emphasizes **continuity and national restoration** in the Messianic future, while the Christian interpretation emphasizes **replacement and spiritual internalization** through Christ. The word "new" (חֲדָשָׁה, *chadashah*) can mean either "brand new" or "renewed," reflecting this fundamental theological divide. This different understanding of Jeremiah 31:31-34 represents one of the core distinctions between Jewish and Christian messianic theology.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Impossibility of Self-Transformation

Jeremiah uniquely emphasizes human inability to change without divine intervention: "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil" (Jeremiah 13:23).

This pessimistic anthropology—humans cannot reform themselves—stands in stark contrast to prophets who simply called for repentance. Jeremiah demonstrates that the call to repent is futile without God's transforming grace. This teaching influenced Paul's doctrine of human sinfulness and divine grace.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Deceitful Heart

Jeremiah's diagnosis of the heart is unique in its bleakness: "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it? I the LORD search the heart and test the mind" (Jeremiah 17:9-10).

While other biblical books mention human sinfulness, Jeremiah's characterization of the heart as inherently deceptive and beyond human understanding is distinctive. This anthropological pessimism explains why external reform fails and why only divine heart-surgery (the New Covenant) can save.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX), although some of the surrounding context (Jeremiah 17:1-4) is absent from the LXX.*

### Circumcision of the Heart

While Deuteronomy mentions heart circumcision (Deuteronomy 10:16, 30:6), Jeremiah develops this concept more fully. God commands: 

> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem... — Jeremiah 4:4 (ESV)

Jeremiah extends this to condemn those who are physically circumcised but spiritually uncircumcised: 

> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh⁠— Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”
— Jeremiah 9:25-26 (ESV)

This teaching that physical markers mean nothing without heart transformation influenced Paul's theology (Romans 2:29).

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Seventy-Year Prophecy

Jeremiah uniquely specifies the duration of Babylonian exile: "This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation" (Jeremiah 25:11-12, 29:10).

This specific timeframe provided hope during the exile and was studied by later prophets like Daniel (Daniel 9:2). The number seventy may be symbolic (10 x 7, representing completeness) or literal, but it assured the exiles that judgment had limits and restoration would come.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### Emphasis on Individual Responsibility

While the principle of individual responsibility existed earlier in Israelite law (e.g., Deuteronomy 24:16), Jeremiah and his contemporary Ezekiel forcefully applied it to counter popular despair during the exile. Jeremiah quotes the proverb, "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge," only to reject it, declaring, "But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge" (Jeremiah 31:29-30).

Jeremiah's unique contribution was his pastoral and theological application of this principle during a time of national catastrophe. He shifted the focus from generational guilt to personal accountability, insisting that each individual is responsible for their own relationship with God. This was a crucial message for the exiles, offering them a path to repentance and restoration that was not dependent on the actions of past generations.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Potter's House: Divine Sovereignty and Human Response

Jeremiah's potter illustration (Jeremiah 18:1-10) presents a unique tension between divine sovereignty and human response. God is like a potter Who has absolute authority over the clay, yet He responds to the clay's condition:

"If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it" (Jeremiah 18:7-8).

This teaching holds together God's sovereignty and human moral responsibility in a unique way—God controls all things, yet genuinely responds to human repentance or rebellion.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Weeping Prophet: God's Emotional Life

Jeremiah uniquely reveals God's emotional anguish over judgment. Unlike prophets who emphasize only divine wrath, Jeremiah shows God's grief:

"Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, declares the Lord" (Jeremiah 31:20).

Jeremiah's own weeping mirrors God's grief: "For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears" ([Lamentations 1:16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamentations), traditionally attributed to Jeremiah). This portrayal of God as grieving—not merely angry—over judgment is Jeremiah's unique contribution to understanding divine pathos.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### Prophetic Celibacy as Sign

God uniquely commands Jeremiah not to marry or have children as a prophetic sign of the coming catastrophe (Jeremiah 16:1-4). This radical lifestyle choice was unprecedented among Hebrew prophets and demonstrated the severity of judgment—children would have no future.

This foreshadows Jesus' and Paul's teachings about celibacy for the sake of the kingdom (Matthew 19:12; 1 Corinthians 7).

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### The Permanence of God's Covenant with Creation

Jeremiah uniquely connects God's covenant faithfulness to the fixed order of creation: "Thus says the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, declares the Lord" (Jeremiah 31:37).

God's covenant with David and Levi is as fixed as the laws governing day and night (Jeremiah 33:20-21). This teaching provided assurance during exile that God's promises remained certain despite apparent abandonment.

*This teaching, particularly the explicit connection to the Davidic covenant in Jeremiah 33:14-26, is unique to the Masoretic Text (MT) and absent from the Septuagint (LXX).*

### Temple as "Den of Robbers"

Jeremiah's Temple Sermon (Jeremiah 7:1-15) uniquely challenges temple theology. While other prophets criticized worship, Jeremiah directly attacked confidence in the temple's inviolability: "Do not trust in these deceptive words: 'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord'" (Jeremiah 7:4).

He compares it to a "den of robbers" (Jeremiah 7:11)—a hideout where criminals feel safe after committing crimes. Jesus quotes this phrase when cleansing the temple (Matthew 21:13), showing Jeremiah's lasting influence.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

### Prophetic Confessions: Honest Wrestling with God

Jeremiah's "confessions" (Jeremiah 11:18-12:6, 15:10-21, 17:14-18, 18:18-23, 20:7-18) are unique in prophetic literature. No other prophet so honestly expresses anger, despair, and questioning toward God:

"Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!" (Jeremiah 20:14).

These confessions provide a model for honest prayer and demonstrate that faithfulness doesn't require suppressing doubt or pain.

*This teaching is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX).*

## Textual Errors

The Book of Jeremiah contains several passages that present historical, chronological, and textual difficulties. These are not merely matters of interpretation but appear to be errors in transmission, editorial confusion, or contradictions with other biblical sources.

Conservative scholars attempt various harmonizations of these difficulties, while critical scholars view them as windows into the text's compositional and transmission history. 

Both perspectives acknowledge the problems exist, differing primarily in whether ancient errors diminish scriptural authority or simply reflect human participation in textual preservation.

### The Date of Jeremiah's Call (Jeremiah 1:2)

**Jeremiah 1:2**: "The word of the LORD came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign."

**The Problem**: If Jeremiah began prophesying in Josiah's 13th year (627 BCE) and continued through the fall of Jerusalem (586 BCE), his ministry lasted over 40 years. However:

1. **Missing oracles**: Jeremiah contains virtually no material from 627-609 BCE (Josiah's reign after the 13th year), particularly nothing about Josiah's reform in 622 BCE
2. **Age issues**: If Jeremiah was a "youth" (*na'ar*) in 627 BCE, he would be quite old by 586 BCE
3. **Jeremiah 3:6** dates an oracle to "the days of Josiah" but seems to reflect post-reform theology

*This dating is present in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and Septuagint (LXX), making it an early tradition rather than a later editorial addition specific to the MT. For discussion of MT vs. LXX differences in Jeremiah, see [The Two Texts of Jeremiah (Biblical Archaeology Society)](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/hebrew-bible/the-two-texts-of-jeremiah/).*

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Two Jeremiahs theory** - An early prophet and later one whose works were combined
2. **Lost northern material** - Early oracles directed at the northern kingdom were lost
3. **Prophetic hiatus** - Jeremiah was silent during Josiah's reform, only resuming after his death
4. **Later superscription** - The date in 1:2 was added by editors and may not be historically accurate

### The Wrong King Reigned in Jeremiah 27

**Jeremiah 27:1** in the Masoretic Text reads:

"In the beginning of the reign of **Jehoiakim** the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD."

**The Problem**: The entire chapter clearly concerns events during **Zedekiah's** reign (mentioned in verses 3, 12), not Jehoiakim's. The context describes ambassadors from surrounding nations coming to Zedekiah, and Jeremiah counseling Zedekiah to submit to Babylon.

**Jewish Scholarly Confirmation**:
Jewish commentators, both classical and modern, have long recognized this discrepancy. For instance, the medieval commentator **Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi)** explicitly identifies "Jehoiakim" as a scribal error that should read "Zedekiah," based on the overwhelming contextual evidence within the chapter. This acknowledgment highlights that textual criticism is not solely a modern phenomenon but has roots in traditional Jewish scholarship.
[See Radak's commentary on Sefaria here.](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.27.1?with=Radak&lang=bi)

**Evidence of Error**:
- Verse 3 mentions "Zedekiah king of Judah"
- Verses 12-22 address Zedekiah directly
- The Septuagint (LXX) lacks verse 1 entirely, thus avoiding the error. This scribal error is specific to the Masoretic Text (MT)
- Most modern translations correct to "Zedekiah" based on context

This appears to be a clear scribal error where "Jehoiakim" was mistakenly written for "Zedekiah," possibly influenced by the superscription at Jeremiah 26:1.

### Baruch's Scroll and the Current Text (Jeremiah 36)

**Jeremiah 36** describes a specific moment when Jeremiah dictated a scroll to his scribe Baruch in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (605 BCE). The scroll contained "all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today" (Jeremiah 36:2). After King Jehoiakim burned this scroll, Jeremiah dictated it again to Baruch, who "wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them" (Jeremiah 36:32).

**The Problem**: If Baruch's rewritten scroll (with additions) was the origin of our current book of Jeremiah, we would expect a relatively straightforward, chronologically organized collection of prophecies from Josiah's reign through 605 BCE. Instead, the actual book of Jeremiah presents multiple problems:

1. **Material from after 605 BCE**: The current book contains extensive material dated after the scroll burning—including prophecies from Zedekiah's reign (597-586 BCE), accounts of Jerusalem's fall (586 BCE), and oracles delivered in Egypt after 586 BCE. These events occurred decades after Baruch wrote the second scroll.

2. **Non-chronological organization**: The book lacks chronological order. For example, chapter 21 (from Zedekiah's reign, c. 588 BCE) appears before chapters 25-29 (from Jehoiakim's reign, c. 605-598 BCE), and oracles against nations appear in different locations in different manuscript traditions.

3. **Two fundamentally different editions**: The shorter Greek Septuagint (LXX) and longer Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) both claim to represent Jeremiah's prophecies, yet they differ by approximately 2,700 words and arrange material in different orders. If both derived from Baruch's single scroll, they should be virtually identical. The existence of two distinct editions suggests a complex transmission history, not simple copying from one authoritative scroll.

**Conclusion**: Jeremiah 36 describes an important early stage in the book's composition—Baruch creating a written record in 605 BCE—but this was clearly not the final form. The scroll burning incident demonstrates that written prophetic collections existed during Jeremiah's lifetime, but the current biblical book underwent extensive editorial development, expansion, and reorganization long after both Jeremiah and Baruch had died.

## Contradictions

The Book of Jeremiah contains numerous internal contradictions and tensions that have puzzled readers throughout history. These contradictions concern theology, ethics, prophecy, and historical details. While some can be explained by development in Jeremiah's thought over his long ministry, others reflect the composite nature of the book assembled from multiple sources.

### Collective or Individual Responsibility? (Jeremiah 16:10-11, 32:18 cf. Jeremiah 31:29-30)

Jeremiah contradicts himself on whether people are punished for their own sins or their ancestors' sins.

#### Collective Punishment

**Jeremiah 16:10-11**: "When you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, 'Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is **the sin that we have committed** against the LORD our God?' then you shall say to them: '**Because your fathers have forsaken me**, declares the LORD...'"

**Jeremiah 32:18**: "You show steadfast love to thousands, but **you repay the guilt of fathers** to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts."

#### Individual Responsibility

**Jeremiah 31:29-30**: "In those days they shall no longer say: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' But **everyone shall die for his own iniquity**. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge."

#### Analysis

There is no theological change or contradiction because these passages addresses **two distinct biblical principles**:

##### Corporate Punishment of the Nation

In Jeremiah 16:10-11, 32:18 God says He will punish the current generation for "their fathers' sins," the critical point is that **the children are also guilty** - they're actively continuing the same idolatry and covenant violations. The phrase "repaying the guilt of fathers to their children" (Jeremiah 32:18) is consistent with Exodus 20:5's "visiting iniquity," which Exodus 34:7 clarifies applies to "those who hate me" - i.e., those who *continue* their ancestors' rebellion.

The children aren't being punished for someone else's sins; they're being punished as a nation because they're committing the *same* sins. This is **corporate punishment** - God judging an entire nation to turn them back to Him through collective consequences (exile, destruction, famine).

##### Individual Death and Personal Judgment

By contrast, Jeremiah 31:29-30 addresses a completely different issue: **individual death and personal salvation** before God. This passage isn't about national punishment at all - it's about each person's individual standing before God and their personal accountability.

The proverb "the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge" reflects the complaint that individuals were dying for their ancestors' sins. God's response: "everyone shall die for his own iniquity." This principle was already established in Deuteronomy 24:16 and addresses personal judgment, not corporate national consequences.

### Does God Change His Mind? (Jeremiah 18:8, 26:3, 42:10 cf. Jeremiah 4:28, 15:6, 20:16)

Jeremiah contains contradictory statements about God's immutability.

#### God Does Change His Mind

**Jeremiah 18:8**: "If that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, **I will relent** of the disaster that I intended to do to it."

**Jeremiah 26:3**: "It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that **I may relent** of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil deeds."

**Jeremiah 26:13**: "Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and **the LORD will relent** of the disaster that he has pronounced against you."

**Jeremiah 42:10**: "If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for **I relent** of the disaster that I did to you."

**God Does Not Change His Mind:**

**Jeremiah 4:28**: "The earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark; for I have spoken; I have purposed; **I have not relented, nor will I turn back**."

**Jeremiah 15:6**: "You have rejected me, declares the LORD; you keep going backward, so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you — **I am weary of relenting**."

**Jeremiah 20:16**: "Let that man be like the cities that **the LORD overthrew without pity**."

#### Analysis

These verses are not contradictory but rather describe **different events and circumstances**. They illustrate the biblical principle of **conditional vs. unconditional prophecies**.

##### Conditional Relenting 

God will relent IF...
- Jeremiah 18:8, 26:3, 26:13, 42:10 all contain **"if" clauses**: "If that nation turns...", "It may be they will listen..."
- These are warnings given *while repentance is still possible*
- God's relenting depends on human response

##### Unconditional Judgment

God will NOT relent when...
- Jeremiah 4:28, 15:6, 20:16 describe situations where the point of no return has been reached
- Jeremiah 15:6 explicitly states "I am weary of relenting" - implying God *has* relented repeatedly before, but now judgment is final
- These passages describe either final judgments after persistent rebellion or completed historical events

##### Theological Framework

This pattern is explained in **Jeremiah 18:7-10** itself, which states God's operating principle: "If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, **if that nation turns from its evil**, I will relent... But if it does evil in my sight... **then I will relent of the good** that I had intended to do to it."

The "will not relent" passages describe circumstances after repeated rejections (note Jeremiah 15:6: "You keep going backward"), not contradictions to God's willingness to show mercy when people genuinely repent.

### Prophecy That Jehoiachin Will Be Childless (Jeremiah 22:24-30 cf. Matthew 1:12)

**Jeremiah 22:24-27** prophesies that Jehoiachin (Coniah) will be "hurled" into another land where "you shall die, and there you shall die."

**Jeremiah 22:30** declares: "Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David."

#### The Problem

1. **Children**: 1 Chronicles 3:17-18 lists seven sons of Jehoiachin
2. **Davidic line**: Matthew's genealogy (Matthew 1:12) traces Jesus through Shealtiel, son of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin)
3. **Zerubbabel**: Grandson of Jehoiachin, served as governor and was promised divine favor in Haggai 2:23

#### Textual Variant in the Septuagint

The Masoretic Text (MT) and Septuagint (LXX) **differ significantly in their translation** of the key descriptor in Jeremiah 22:30:

| Text | Word | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Masoretic Text** (Hebrew) | עֲרִירִ֖י (*ariri*) | "Childless" or "stripped/bare" |
| **Septuagint** (Greek) | ἐκκήρυκτον (*ekkērykton*) | "Outcast," "expelled," or "proscribed" |

The LXX translators chose a word emphasizing his **public rejection and exile** rather than literal childlessness. The Greek ἐκκήρυκτον means someone "proclaimed" or "publicly banished"—focusing on his removal from the royal succession rather than his biological offspring.

#### Other Harmonizations

1. **"Childless" means without royal successor**: The prophecy was fulfilled—none of Jeconiah's descendants actually reigned as king in Judah. While Jeconiah had biological children (1 Chronicles 3:17-18), no offspring sat on David's throne in Jerusalem during the exile or after.

2. **The curse was conditionally lifted**: Jeconiah repented in exile (2 Kings 25:27-30 records his release and honor in Babylon). God's promise to Zerubbabel, Jeconiah's grandson (Haggai 2:23), suggests the curse was lifted based on repentance.

3. **Legal vs. biological lineage**: Matthew traces Jesus' legal right through Joseph (who descended from Jeconiah), while Luke 3:23-38 traces biological descent through Mary (through Nathan, not Solomon, thus avoiding Jeconiah entirely). Jesus inherits the legal claim to David's throne through Joseph without being biologically under the curse.

4. **Messiah as exception**: The curse applied to human monarchy in fallen Israel; Jesus' eternal kingship, established by divine decree and resurrection, transcends and supersedes the temporal curse on Jeconiah's earthly dynasty.

### The Seventy-Year Prophecy (Jeremiah 25:11-12 cf. Jeremiah 29:10)

One of the most debated "errors" concerns Jeremiah's prophecy about **the duration of Babylonian captivity**:

**Jeremiah 25:11-12**: "This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation..."

**Jeremiah 29:10**: "For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place."

**The Problem**: The historical duration doesn't match the prophecy:
- Fall of Jerusalem: 586 BCE
- Cyrus's decree allowing return: 538 BCE
- **Actual duration: 48 years**, not 70

**Attempted Harmonizations**:

1. **Neo-Babylonian Empire duration** (609-539 BCE) = approximately 70 years from Battle of Carchemish to fall of Babylon
2. **Temple to Temple** - From destruction of Solomon's Temple (586 BCE) to dedication of Second Temple (516 BCE) = 70 years
3. **Round number** - "Seventy" as a symbolic/round number for a complete period rather than exact chronology
4. **Jehoiakim's reign** - Counting from first deportation in 605 BCE to 536 BCE = approximately 70 years
5. **Two Separate Prophecies** - Jeremiah 25:11-12 and Jeremiah 29:10 refer to two overlapping but distinct 70-year periods. Jeremiah 25:11-12 prophesies 70 years of Babylonian imperial dominance (609-539 BCE from Battle of Carchemish to Babylon's fall), while Jeremiah 29:10 prophesies 70 years of Israel's temple desolation and exile (586-516 BCE from temple destruction to Second Temple completion). The ambiguous Hebrew preposition in Jeremiah 29:10 (לְבָבֶל) permits "seventy years *for* Babylon" rather than only "seventy years *at* Babylon," suggesting different referents. Daniel 9:2, written around 539 BCE at Babylon's fall, understood the 70 years as still ongoing—a timing that fits if the prophecy concerned temple desolation (586-516 BCE) rather than Babylonian dominance (already ending). This interpretation maintains prophetic precision while explaining why both periods align exactly with major historical events.

2 Chronicles 36:21 interprets the 70 years as sabbath rest for the land, while Daniel 9:2 treats it as a precise prophetic number requiring further interpretation.

### Resist or Submit to Babylon? (Jeremiah 27:8-11 cf. Jeremiah 38:17-18)

The most prominent contradiction concerns Jeremiah's counsel regarding Babylon.

#### Submission to Babylon Commanded

> “But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, **I will punish that nation** with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence”, declares the LORD, “until I have consumed it by his hand. So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’ For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish. But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, **I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there**”, declares the LORD. — Jeremiah 27:8-11 (ESV)

> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: **If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire**, and you and your house shall live. But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.” — Jeremiah 38:17-18 (ESV)

#### Resistance to Babylon Encouraged

> Thus says the LORD: “Behold, **I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon**, against the inhabitants of Leb-kamai, and I will send to Babylon winnowers, and they shall winnow her, and they shall empty her land, when they come against her from every side on the day of trouble. 
>
>...
>
> “Sharpen the arrows! Take up the shields! **The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes**, because **His purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it**, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for His temple.
>
> ...
>
> “**Go out of the midst of her**, My people! Let every one save his life from the fierce anger of the LORD!
>
> — Jeremiah 51:1-2,11,45 (ESV)

#### Analysis

These are two different prophecies of two different events:
* Jeremiah 27:8-11, 38:17-18 refer to Babylon capturing Judah.
* Jeremiah 51:1-45 refer to a later event of where Babylon is destroyed by the Medes.

Critiques question whether Jeremiah considered Babylon God's instrument or enemy?

Throughout Scripture, God repeatedly uses His enemies as instruments to fulfill His purposes, then judges them for their wickedness. Babylon is not unique in this dual role. For example:
* The Pharoah in Egypt (Exodus 14:4-17)
* Assyria (Isaiah 10:5-12)
* Chaldeans (Habakkuk 1:6-13)
* The cruxifixion (Acts 2:23, 4:27-28)

This is not a contradition.

### Prophecies About Zedekiah's Death (Jeremiah 32:1-5, 34:4-22 cf. Jeremiah 52:10-11)

Jeremiah gives contradictory prophecies about King Zedekiah's fate that remain difficult to reconcile even when accounting for chronology and conditional prophecy.

#### The Sequence

1. **Year 10**: Jeremiah 32:4-5 predicts Zedekiah will be captured: "Zedekiah... shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon."

2. **Year 10/11** (during siege interruption): Jeremiah 34:4-5 promises peaceful death: "You shall not die by the sword. You shall **die in peace**. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you."

3. **Year 10/11**: Zedekiah breaks covenant to free slaves. God responds (Jeremiah 34:17, 21): "I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine... **Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies**."

4. **Year 11** (what happened): Jeremiah 52:10-11: "The king of Babylon **slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes**, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. He **put out the eyes of Zedekiah**... and **put him in prison till the day of his death**." Multiple biblical books independently confirm Zedekiah's brutal fate:
  - **2 Kings 25:6-7** and **2 Chronicles 36:11-21** provide parallel accounts: sons executed before him, blinded, imprisoned until death.
  - **Ezekiel 12:13** (independent prophetic tradition) prophesied beforehand that Zedekiah would be brought to Babylon but "not see it"—fulfilled when he was blinded at Riblah before transport. According to Josephus (*Antiquities* 10.7.2), Zedekiah refused to believe Jeremiah because Ezekiel's prophecy seemed contradictory. Both were literally fulfilled through the blinding.

#### The Problems

1. Why would Jeremiah promise a peaceful death with honorable burial **after** already predicting captivity? 
2. How does either prophecy match the horrific outcome which was that his sons were executed before his eyes, and then he was blinded and imprisoned until death?
3. Why does the "peaceful death" promise contradict the other historical accounts in the Bible?

#### Possible explanations

1. **Conditional reprieve**: The peaceful death offer was conditional on obedience, forfeited when Zedekiah broke covenant (Jeremiah 34:8-22). However, this struggles to explain why peaceful death would be promised after captivity was already declared certain. The condition is not explicitly stated beforehand in the peaceful death prophecy itself.

2. **Technical fulfillment**: Zedekiah didn't die "by the sword" (execution), but instead he died of natural causes in prison. However, calling imprisonment after witnessing your sons' execution and being blinded a "peaceful" death stretches the meaning of שָׁלוֹם (peace) beyond normal usage. The promise included burial honors "as spices were burned for your fathers"—there's no evidence this occurred.

**Textual and Historical Context:**

Jeremiah 52 (which records the outcome) is entirely absent from the LXX (earlier edition), though present in the MT. [Chapter 52 was copied from 2 Kings 24-25 by later editors](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/jeremiah-52-context-book-jeremiah) who had access to that historical account.

#### External sources 

([Babylonian Chronicles](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-5-jerusalem-chronicle/), discovered 1956) confirm Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns and Zedekiah's appointment, plus archaeological evidence (destruction layers, [Lachish Ostraca](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/the-lachish-letters/), [clay bullae](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/artifacts-and-the-bible/jeremiah-prophet-of-the-bible-brought-back-to-life/) with names from Jeremiah 38). However, the Chronicles only cover events to 594 BCE—no external verification of the 587 BCE siege or Zedekiah's specific fate exists. We're comparing biblical prophecies with biblical fulfillment claims, lacking independent corroboration.

### Conflicting Accounts of Jerusalem's Fall (Jeremiah 39:9 cf. Jeremiah 52:12-30)

Jeremiah contains two accounts of Jerusalem's fall with notable discrepancies:

**Jeremiah 39:1-10** and **Jeremiah 52:4-30** (parallel to 2 Kings 25)

**Discrepancies**:

1. **Nebuzaradan's arrival**:
   - Jeremiah 39:9 - Seems to arrive immediately
   - Jeremiah 52:12 - Arrives "in the fifth month, on the tenth day"

2. **Number deported**:
   - Jeremiah 52:28-30 gives specific numbers: 3,023 (7th year of Nebuchadnezzar), 832 (18th year), 745 (23rd year) = 4,600 total
   - 2 Kings 24:14 reports 10,000 captives from the first deportation (597 BCE)
   - 2 Kings 24:16 breaks this down differently: 7,000 men of valor plus 1,000 craftsmen/smiths = 8,000
   - 2 Kings 25:11 provides no specific number for the final deportation, only "the rest of the people"

3. **MT preserves the complete account**: Jeremiah 39:4-13 (the account of Zedekiah's flight and capture) is present in the MT but absent from the LXX. The MT preserves the actual historical event, which also appears independently in 2 Kings 25, confirming this was part of the historical record. The LXX omission likely represents an earlier, abbreviated edition that lacked this narrative detail.

**Why the Numbers Differ**: The deportation figures present a genuine puzzle. For the same first deportation in 597 BCE:
   - Jeremiah 52:28 reports **3,023** people
   - 2 Kings 24:16 reports **8,000** (just men of valor and craftsmen, not including general population)
   - 2 Kings 24:14 reports **10,000** total

The discrepancy is significant: if 8,000 represents only military men and craftsmen, the total should be far higher than 3,023, not lower. Several explanations have been proposed:

   1. **Different counting systems**: Jeremiah may count only Judean citizens deported, while 2 Kings includes broader populations (foreigners, servants, families of the deported)
   2. **Rounded vs. precise numbers**: 2 Kings may use rounded estimates (10,000, 8,000) while Jeremiah preserves exact administrative records (3,023)
   3. **Different deportation events**: Though both claim to describe 597 BCE, they may reference different waves or groups within that year
   4. **Textual corruption**: Numbers are notoriously susceptible to scribal errors in transmission (Hebrew letters also serve as numerals)

Notably, even within 2 Kings itself there's inconsistency (10,000 vs. 8,000). This suggests the biblical authors themselves worked with conflicting source materials and preserved both traditions rather than harmonizing them. The core historical reality (major deportations occurred) remains undisputed; the precise numbers reflect irreconcilable differences in the ancient sources

These discrepancies suggest multiple sources were combined without complete harmonization.

### The Fate of Egypt (Jeremiah 46:25-26 cf. Ezekiel 29:10-12)

Jeremiah's version of the future:

> The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said: “Behold, I am bringing punishment upon Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh and Egypt and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him. **I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their life, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in the days of old, declares the LORD.** — Jeremiah 46:25-26 (ESV)

*This passage exists in both the Masoretic Text (MT) and Septuagint (LXX) with similar content, although in different chapters (26:25-26 in LXX numbering).*

Ezekiel's version of the future:

> Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast, and **the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste**. Then they will know that I am the LORD.	“Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, and I made it,’ therefore, behold, I am against you and against your streams, and **I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation**, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush. **No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years**. And **I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries**, and her **cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste**. I will **scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries**. — Ezekiel 29:8-12 (ESV)

**Historical Reality**: Nebuchadnezzar's Egyptian campaign (568-567 BCE) did not result in Egypt's destruction or forty-year desolation. Egypt continued as a functioning kingdom.

#### Analysis

This contradiction extends beyond Jeremiah to include Ezekiel, and [both prophetic predictions failed to match historical reality](https://rarebible.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/ezekiels-false-prophecy-against-egypt/).

### Can Jerusalem Be Saved? (Jeremiah 14:11-12, 15:1 cf. Jeremiah 26:3, 38:17)

#### Judgment Is Inevitable

**Jeremiah 14:11-12**: "Do not pray for the welfare of this people. Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them."

**Jeremiah 15:1**: "Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of My sight, and let them go!"

#### Salvation Is Possible

**Jeremiah 26:3**: "It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them."

**Jeremiah 38:17**: "If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire."

#### Analysis

Early in the book, judgment becomes inevitable regardless of repentance; later, repentance could avert judgment. This inverted chronology creates tension about whether God's judgment is conditional or predetermined, and whether a "point of no return" had actually been reached.

## Credibility

Major [textual variants](#textual-variants):
* The **Septuagint (LXX)**, which is the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, but earlier version.
* The **Masoretic Text (MT)**, which is the standard Hebrew Bible and **the basis for most modern English translations**.

It is debatable whether the Masoretic Text errors are due to unfulfilled prophecies or incorrectly recorded events.
