# Matthew

## Authorship

The traditional Christian view, supported by unanimous early church testimony, maintains that the Gospel of Matthew was written by the apostle Matthew, an eyewitness to Jesus's ministry. 

However, significant scholarly debate exists regarding this attribution, particularly concerning the literary relationship between Matthew and Mark.

### The Scholarly Debate

The primary challenge to traditional authorship concerns the literary relationship between Matthew and Mark. These two Gospels share extensive material—approximately 90% of Mark's content appears in Matthew (see [Cross-References](#cross-references) section). This raises a critical question: which Gospel was written first, and did one author copy from the other?

### Two Main Positions

1. **Markan Priority (Critical Scholarly Consensus):** Most modern biblical scholars conclude that Mark was written first (~65-70 CE), and Matthew was composed later (~80-90 CE) by an anonymous author who used Mark as a primary source. This view argues that if Matthew the apostle had been an eyewitness to Jesus's ministry, he would not need to copy so extensively from Mark, who was not an eyewitness but recorded Peter's testimony secondhand. The heavy literary dependence on Mark suggests the author of Matthew's Gospel was not himself an eyewitness but relied on earlier written sources.

2. **Matthean Priority or Literary Independence (Traditional/Conservative View):** Conservative scholars defend apostolic authorship in several ways: 
- Matthew may have been written first, with Mark abbreviating it; - both may have drawn from common oral or written sources independently;
- even eyewitnesses commonly used existing sources to structure their accounts in the ancient world, so Matthew's use of Mark as a framework doesn't preclude eyewitness authorship. This view emphasizes that the unanimous early church testimony attributing the Gospel to Matthew should not be dismissed lightly.

### Key Evidence for Matthean Authorship

*   **Unanimous Early Testimony:** The earliest Christian writers, like Papias (c. 60-130 CE) and Irenaeus (c. 130-202 CE), attribute the Gospel to Matthew. This [unbroken tradition](https://www.atrustworthygospel.com/does-the-early-church-unanimously-testify-that-matthew-wrote-the-gospel-of-matthew/), originating from a time when the apostles' testimony was still accessible, is a powerful argument for his authorship.
*   **Universal Manuscript Tradition:** Every ancient manuscript of the Gospel that bears a title names Matthew as the author. No competing author was ever suggested in antiquity.
*   **Internal Clues:** The author's familiarity with Jewish customs, Aramaic, and financial matters are all [internal clues](https://crossexamined.org/what-is-the-internal-evidence-for-the-authorship-of-matthews-gospel/) that fit the profile of a tax collector. The Gospel even uses the name "Matthew" for the tax collector called by Jesus (Matthew 9:9), whereas Mark and Luke use "Levi"—a subtle authorial signature.

## Historical Environment

The Gospel of Matthew was written during a critical era for Judaism under Roman occupation. The political climate was oppressive, marked by the brutal reign of Herod the Great and direct Roman governance by prefects like Pontius Pilate. This subjugation fueled intense messianic expectations among the Jewish people, who anticipated a king to restore Israel's political sovereignty.

First-century Jewish culture was shaped by various religious sects, including the Pharisees and Sadducees, who frequently appear in the narrative as Jesus's opponents. Matthew presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah but redefines his role, emphasizing spiritual redemption over political revolution.

The Gospel's composition reflects this tense environment. If written in the 60s CE, it captures the turmoil preceding the First Jewish-Roman War. If written later, in the 80s-90s CE, it addresses the trauma following the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE. This later context would explain the conflict between the Matthean community and the emerging form of rabbinic Judaism, as both groups claimed to be the true continuation of Israel's heritage. This historical backdrop is essential for understanding Matthew's focus on Jesus as the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy.

## Purpose

The Gospel of Matthew’s primary purpose is to **demonstrate conclusively that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised [Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecy](https://prophecies.ofgod.info)** and [establishes the Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info).

1. Matthew establishes that Jesus’s messianic identity for a Jewish audience. The Gospel opens with a genealogy tracing Jesus’s lineage through David to Abraham (Matthew 1:1-17), securing His legal claim to the throne. Throughout the book, Matthew repeatedly uses the royal title “son of David” to emphasize Jesus’s credentials. The author systematically validates Jesus’s life and ministry by employing numerous “fulfillment citations” that connect His actions to specific Old Testament prophecies. Key examples include His virgin birth (Matthew 1:22-23; Isaiah 7:14), Bethlehem birthplace (Matthew 2:5-6; Micah 5:2), return from Egypt (Matthew 2:15; Hosea 11:1), healing ministry (Matthew 8:17; Isaiah 53:4), and triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:4-5; Zechariah 9:9). This technique argues that Jesus was not an accident of history but the intentional climax of God’s redemptive plan.
2. Matthew proclaims the arrival of the “kingdom of heaven,” a phrase used 32 times and unique to this Gospel. Jesus’s central message, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matthew 4:17), redefines Jewish messianic expectations. The kingdom arrives not through political revolution but through Jesus’s authoritative teaching, miraculous power, sacrificial death, and resurrection. Entry is granted based on repentance, faith, and a righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 5:20).
3. Matthew's Gospel message serves as a foundational document for [the body of Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod/christ/body). It is the only Gospel to use the term “church” (ekklēsia, Matthew 16:18; 18:17) and provides instruction on community discipline (Matthew 18), and mission. The content is organized into five major discourses, including the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), which provide systematic teaching for Christian discipleship. This instruction culminates in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), which defines the church’s ongoing mission to make disciples of all nations.
4. Matthew contrasts authentic righteousness with the hypocrisy of the religious leaders (Matthew 23) and defends Jesus against Jewish objections, such as His association with sinners (Matthew 9:13) or His actions on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:8). While deeply Jewish, the Gospel also universalizes salvation, making it clear that the kingdom is open to Gentiles who demonstrate faith (Matthew 8:11-12; 28:19).

## Cross-References

## Canonical Status

Matthew achieved uncontested canonical status from the earliest period of church history, earlier than other canonical Gospels. **Early Patristic Attestation** includes Papias (c. 60-130 CE), who identifies Matthew as author; the Didache (c. 70-110 CE), which extensively quotes Matthew; Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 CE), who cites Matthew more than other Gospels; and Irenaeus (c. 130-202 CE), who explicitly affirms the fourfold Gospel canon.

**Manuscript Evidence**: Matthew appears in all major early manuscripts. Papyri fragments from the 2nd-3rd centuries (P64+67, P104) demonstrate circulation within 100 years of composition. Major uncial codices (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, Bezae, Washingtonianus) all place Matthew first among the Gospels.

**Early Canonical Lists**: Matthew appears in every known early canonical list, including the Muratorian Fragment (c. 170-200 CE), Origen's writings, Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Athanasius' Festal Letter (367 CE), and the councils of Hippo (393 CE) and Carthage (397 CE, 419 CE).

**Liturgical Usage and Patristic Commentary**: Matthew's comprehensive teaching—particularly the Sermon on the Mount and the Great Commission—made it foundational for Christian worship and instruction. Origen, John Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustine all produced extensive commentaries, treating Matthew as a trustworthy historical and theological source.

**Unanimous Recognition**: Matthew experienced no canonical disputes. Even heretical groups accepted it. By the late 2nd century, the fourfold canon achieved universal recognition. Eastern and Western churches unanimously accepted Matthew, as did the Protestant Reformers and modern ecumenical bodies.

## Summary

The Gospel of Matthew presents Jesus of Nazareth as the Jewish Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecy, establishes God's kingdom, and sends His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The Gospel's 28 chapters systematically demonstrate Jesus' identity through genealogy, teaching, miracles, death, resurrection, and commission.

### The Messiah's Birth and Infancy

Matthew opens with Jesus' genealogy tracing His lineage through David to Abraham (Matthew 1:1-17), establishing His legal right to David's throne. The genealogy emphasizes Jesus as "the Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" (Matthew 1:1), immediately positioning Him within Israel's covenantal history. The virgin birth fulfills Isaiah 7:14: "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (Matthew 1:22-23). An angel commands Joseph: "you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

Magi from the east worship the newborn king (Matthew 2:1-12), while Herod's paranoid massacre of Bethlehem's infants (Matthew 2:16-18) fulfills Jeremiah 31:15. The family's flight to and return from Egypt fulfills Hosea 11:1: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Matthew 2:15).

### Jesus' Preparation

John the Baptist prepares the way, proclaiming, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 3:2), fulfilling Isaiah 40:3. At Jesus' baptism, the heavens open and God declares, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17). 

### Jesus' Temptation

The Spirit leads Jesus into the wilderness where Satan tempts Him (Matthew 4:1-11). Jesus defeats each temptation with Scripture, commanding Satan, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Matthew 4:10, quoting Deuteronomy 6:13).

### The Sermon on the Mount

Jesus begins His Galilean ministry, proclaiming, "Repent, for [the kingdom of heaven](https://kingdom.ofgod.info) is at hand" (Matthew 4:17). He calls His first disciples with the command, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19).

Jesus delivers His first major discourse, presenting the kingdom's ethics and righteousness. The Beatitudes pronounce blessings: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:3); "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" (Matthew 5:4); through "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:10). Jesus declares His disciples to be "the salt of the earth" and "the light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14), commanding them to "let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).

Jesus teaches that he came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 5:17), establishing that "unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:20). Six antitheses demonstrate kingdom ethics: 

1. on murder (Matthew 5:21-26),
2. adultery (Matthew 5:27-30),
3. divorce (Matthew 5:31-32),
4. oaths (Matthew 5:33-37),
5. retaliation (Matthew 5:38-42), and
6. love for enemies (Matthew 5:43-48). 

Jesus commands, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44), concluding, "You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).

Chapter 6 addresses authentic piety: giving alms, praying, and fasting in secret rather than for human praise (Matthew 6:1-18). Jesus teaches the Lord's Prayer: "[Our Father](https://ofgod.info) in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven..." (Matthew 6:9-13). He commands, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth...but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" (Matthew 6:19-20), teaching that "you cannot serve God and money" (Matthew 6:24). Jesus addresses anxiety: "do not be anxious about your life" (Matthew 6:25), commanding instead, "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).

Chapter 7 warns against judging others (Matthew 7:1-5), teaches prayer persistence (Matthew 7:7-11), and presents the Golden Rule: "whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 7:12). Jesus commands, "Enter by the narrow gate" (Matthew 7:13), warning that "the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many" (Matthew 7:13). He warns against false prophets (Matthew 7:15-20) and declares that many will claim, "Lord, Lord," but only "the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" will enter the kingdom (Matthew 7:21). The discourse concludes with the parable of the wise and foolish builders (Matthew 7:24-27), emphasizing that hearing and doing Jesus' words provides secure foundation.

### Mighty Works

Jesus demonstrates his authority through ten miracles: 
1. cleansing a leper (Matthew 8:1-4), 
2. healing the centurion's servant (Matthew 8:5-13), 
3. healing Peter's mother-in-law and many others (Matthew 8:14-17), 
4. calming the storm (Matthew 8:23-27), 
5. casting out demons from the Gadarene demoniacs (Matthew 8:28-34), 
6. healing a paralytic (Matthew 9:1-8), 
7. raising Jairus' daughter (Matthew 9:18-26), 
8. healing the woman with a discharge of blood (Matthew 9:20-22), 
9. healing two blind men (Matthew 9:27-31), and 
10. healing a mute demoniac (Matthew 9:32-34).

### Growing Opposition

Jesus calls Matthew the tax collector with the simple command, "Follow me" (Matthew 9:9). When Pharisees question His association with sinners, Jesus declares, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" (Matthew 9:12), commanding them, "Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matthew 9:13, quoting Hosea 6:6).

### The Mission Discourse

Jesus commissions the Twelve, giving them "authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction" (Matthew 10:1). He commands them: "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Matthew 10:5-6). Their message: "[The kingdom of heaven](https://kingdom.ofgod.info) is at hand" (Matthew 10:7). Jesus instructs, "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay" (Matthew 10:8).

Jesus warns of coming persecution: "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). He promises, "do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you" (Matthew 10:19-20). Jesus declares, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28). He warns, "whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 10:33), yet promises, "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me" (Matthew 10:40).

### Mounting Opposition

When John sends disciples asking if Jesus is "the one who is to come," Jesus responds by pointing to His works fulfilling Isaiah's prophecies (Matthew 11:2-6). Jesus testifies about John, declaring, "among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist" (Matthew 11:11), yet "the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he" (Matthew 11:11).

Jesus pronounces woes on unrepentant cities (Matthew 11:20-24), then issues His gracious invitation: "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:28-30).

Conflict escalates over Sabbath observance (Matthew 12:1-14). Jesus declares, "the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:8). When Pharisees accuse Him of casting out demons by Beelzebul, Jesus warns against blasphemy of the Holy Spirit: "whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come" (Matthew 12:32). He teaches that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matthew 12:34), warning, "on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak" (Matthew 12:36).

### The Parables Discourse

Jesus presents seven [parables revealing kingdom](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/parables) mysteries. 

1. The parable of the sower (Matthew 13:1-23) teaches that the word produces varying results based on receptivity. Jesus explains that He speaks in parables to reveal truth to disciples while concealing it from hard-hearted hearers (Matthew 13:10-17). 
2. The parables of the weeds (Matthew 13:24-30, explained in Matthew 13:36-43), 
3. the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32), and 
4. the leaven (Matthew 13:33) illustrate the kingdom's nature and growth. 
5. The parables of the hidden treasure (Matthew 13:44) and 
6. the pearl of great value (Matthew 13:45-46) demonstrate the kingdom's surpassing worth. 
7. The parable of the net (Matthew 13:47-50) depicts final judgment separating righteous from wicked.

### More Miracles and Opposition

John the Baptist's beheading (Matthew 14:1-12) demonstrates opposition's intensity. 

Jesus feeds five thousand (Matthew 14:13-21), walks on water (Matthew 14:22-33), and heals many (Matthew 14:34-36). 

Conflict with Pharisees continues over tradition (Matthew 15:1-20). Jesus teaches, "it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person" (Matthew 15:11).

The Canaanite woman's persistent faith receives commendation (Matthew 15:21-28). Jesus feeds four thousand (Matthew 15:32-39) and warns against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matthew 16:5-12).

### Revelation

At Caesarea Philippi, Peter confesses, "You are [the Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ), the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16). Jesus responds, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my *[church](https://church.ofgod.info)*, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 16:17-19). Jesus begins predicting His death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21), commanding disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" (Matthew 16:24).

The Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-13) reveals Jesus' glory as God declares, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him" (Matthew 17:5). 

Jesus heals an epileptic boy (Matthew 17:14-21), again predicts His death (Matthew 17:22-23), and provides temple tax through miraculous means (Matthew 17:24-27).

### The Community Discourse

Jesus teaches kingdom humility: "unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3). He warns, "whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matthew 18:6). The parable of the lost sheep (Matthew 18:10-14) demonstrates God's concern for each believer.

Jesus establishes the discipline procedures (Matthew 18:15-20), promising, "where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them" (Matthew 18:20). He teaches unlimited forgiveness through the parable of the unforgiving servant (Matthew 18:21-35), warning that God will not forgive those who refuse to forgive others (Matthew 18:35).

### Journey to Jerusalem

Jesus teaches God's design for marriage: "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (Matthew 19:4-6, quoting Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2:24). He blesses children (Matthew 19:13-15) and teaches the rich young ruler about eternal life (Matthew 19:16-30), declaring, "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24).

The parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) teaches kingdom grace. Jesus predicts His death a third time (Matthew 20:17-19) and teaches servant leadership: "whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Matthew 20:26-28).

Jesus enters Jerusalem triumphantly (Matthew 21:1-11), fulfilling Zechariah 9:9. He cleanses the temple, declaring, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers" (Matthew 21:13, quoting Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11). Through parables—the two sons (Matthew 21:28-32), the wicked tenants (Matthew 21:33-46), and the wedding feast (Matthew 22:1-14)—Jesus pronounces judgment on Israel's leaders while warning that "many are called, but few are chosen" (Matthew 22:14).

### Confrontation

Religious leaders test Jesus with questions about taxes (Matthew 22:15-22), resurrection (Matthew 22:23-33), and the greatest commandment (Matthew 22:34-40). Jesus summarizes the Law: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 22:37-40, quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18).

Matthew 23 contains Jesus' extensive denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, pronouncing seven woes against their hypocrisy. 

1. Jesus condemns them for teaching but not practicing (Matthew 23:3), 
2. burdening others while avoiding burdens (Matthew 23:4), 
3. performing religious acts for praise (Matthew 23:5-7), 
4. shutting the kingdom against people (Matthew 23:13), 
5. making converts twice the sons of hell (Matthew 23:15), 
6. neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness while tithing minutiae (Matthew 23:23), appearing righteous outwardly while full of hypocrisy inwardly (Matthew 23:27-28), and
7. persecuting prophets (Matthew 23:29-36). 

Jesus laments over Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!" (Matthew 23:37).

### The Eschatological Discourse

Jesus predicts the temple's destruction (Matthew 24:1-2) and describes signs preceding His return: 

- false messiahs (Matthew 24:5,11,24), 
- wars (Matthew 24:6-7), 
- famines and earthquakes (Matthew 24:7), 
- persecution (Matthew 24:9-10), and 
- gospel proclamation to all nations (Matthew 24:14). 

Jesus describes the great tribulation (Matthew 24:15-28) and His glorious return: "they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matthew 24:30). He commands watchfulness: "stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming" (Matthew 24:42).

Three parables emphasize readiness: 

1. the faithful and wise servant (Matthew 24:45-51), 
2. the ten virgins (Matthew 25:1-13), and 
3. the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). 

The judgment scene (Matthew 25:31-46) depicts the Son of Man separating sheep from goats based on treatment of "the least of these." The King declares, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 25:34) to those who fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, and visited the sick and imprisoned. To the cursed He says, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41), concluding, "these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew 25:46).

### Passion

Jewish leaders plot Jesus' death (Matthew 26:1-5). A woman anoints Jesus at Bethany (Matthew 26:6-13); Judas agrees to betray Him for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14-16). At the Last Supper, Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body" (Matthew 26:26) and "Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matthew 26:27-28).

In Gethsemane, Jesus prays, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will" (Matthew 26:39). Judas betrays Him with a kiss (Matthew26:47-56). Before the high priest, Jesus affirms His identity: "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matthew 26:64, referencing Psalm 110:1 and Daniel 7:13). Peter denies Jesus three times (Matthew 26:69-75).

Judas, filled with remorse, returns the thirty pieces of silver and hangs himself (Matthew 27:3-10). Jesus stands before Pilate, who asks, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answers, "You have said so" (Matthew 27:11). The crowd chooses Barabbas over Jesus (Matthew 27:15-26). Soldiers mock Jesus, placing a crown of thorns on His head and a reed in His hand, kneeling before Him saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" (Matthew 27:27-31).

### Jesus' Death

Jesus is crucified at Golgotha (Matthew 27:32-44). From the cross He cries, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, quoting Psalm 22:1). At His death, "the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split" (Matthew 27:51). The centurion declares, "Truly this was the Son of God!" (Matthew 27:54). Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus in his own new tomb (Matthew 27:57-61). Religious leaders seal and guard the tomb (Matthew 27:62-66).

### Jesus' Resurrection

On the third day, an angel rolls back the stone, declaring to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, as he said" (Matthew 28:5-6). The angel commands them, "go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead" (Matthew 28:7). Jesus appears to the women, greeting them and commanding, "go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me" (Matthew 28:10).

Guards report to the chief priests, who bribe them to spread the false story that disciples stole the body (Matthew 28:11-15). The Gospel concludes with the Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20). Jesus declares, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18), then commands His disciples: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20). Jesus' final promise concludes the Gospel: "And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matthew 28:20).

### Commission

Throughout these 28 chapters, Matthew presents Jesus as the authoritative teacher, the miracle-working Messiah who demonstrates God's kingdom power, the suffering servant who gives His life as a ransom, and the risen Lord who commissions [his body](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ/body) to disciple all nations. Every major teaching, command, and promise emphasizes Jesus' role as the fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes and the foundation of the new covenant community.

## Unique Teachings

The Gospel of Matthew contains several distinctive theological and literary contributions that either appear only in this Gospel or receive unique emphasis compared to the other three canonical Gospels. These unique elements establish Matthew's particular witness to Jesus Christ and demonstrate the Spirit's intention that each Gospel present complementary perspectives on the same Lord.

### Unique Infancy Narrative Details

While both Matthew and Luke contain infancy narratives, Matthew's version includes unique elements: 

* Joseph's perspective rather than Mary's, 
* the magi's visit guided by the star (Matthew 2:1-12), 
* Herod's massacre of the innocents (Matthew 2:16-18), and 
* the flight to and return from Egypt (Matthew 2:13-23). 

These details, each accompanied by fulfillment quotations, establish [Jesus' royal messianic identity](https://prophecies.ofgod.info) and position Him within Israel's exodus typology.

### The Phrase "Kingdom of Heaven"

Matthew's most distinctive terminological contribution is the phrase "kingdom of heaven" (ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν), appearing 32 times throughout the Gospel. This phrase occurs nowhere in Mark, Luke, or John, though Matthew also uses "kingdom of God" five times (Matthew 12:28, 19:24, 21:31,43). Scholars debate whether "kingdom of heaven" represents Jewish circumlocution avoiding the divine name or carries distinct theological meaning. Regardless, this distinctive phrase characterizes Matthew's Gospel, appearing in key passages: Jesus' proclamation "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 4:17), the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3,10), entrance requirements (Matthew 5:20, 7:21, 18:3, 19:14), and the parables (Matthew 13:11,24,31,33,44,45,47,52).

### The Sermon on the Mount

While Luke contains a shorter "Sermon on the Plain" (Luke 6:20-49), Matthew's Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) stands as the most comprehensive presentation of Jesus' ethical teaching. Unique elements include portions of the Beatitudes, the antitheses contrasting "you have heard...but I say to you" (Matthew 5:21-48), extensive teaching on piety (Matthew 6:1-18), material possessions and anxiety (Matthew 6:19-34), and the parable of the wise and foolish builders (Matthew 7:24-27). The Sermon's programmatic placement at the beginning of Jesus' ministry establishes His teaching authority as the foundation for everything that follows.

### Unique Parables

Matthew contains several parables found in no other Gospel. 

* The weeds among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30,36-43) teaches patient endurance until final judgment. 
* The hidden treasure (Matthew 13:44) and the pearl of great value (Matthew 13:45-46) illustrate the kingdom's surpassing worth requiring total commitment. 
* The net (Matthew 13:47-50) depicts final separation of righteous and wicked. 
* The unforgiving servant (Matthew 18:23-35) warns that refusal to forgive others results in divine judgment. 
* The workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) demonstrates kingdom grace overturning human merit expectations. 
* The two sons (Matthew 21:28-32) contrasts verbal profession with actual obedience. 
* The ten virgins (Matthew 25:1-13) emphasizes preparedness for Christ's return. 
* The talents (Matthew 25:14-30) teaches faithful stewardship. 
* The sheep and goats judgment (Matthew 25:31-46) depicts final separation based on treatment of "the least of these."

### Peter Walking on Water

While all Synoptics record Jesus walking on water, only Matthew includes Peter's attempt to walk on water, his beginning to sink when doubting, and Jesus' rebuke: "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" (Matthew 14:28-31). This unique episode emphasizes faith's necessity for participating in Jesus' supernatural work.

### The Only Gospel Using Ekklēsia

Matthew uniquely employs the term *"[church](https://church.ofgod.info)"* (ἐκκλησία) in the Gospels, appearing twice: 

1. Jesus' promise to Peter, "on this rock I will build my *church*" (Matthew 16:18), and 
2. instructions for *church* discipline, "tell it to *the church*" (Matthew 18:17). This terminological distinctiveness indicates Matthew's particular concern for ecclesiology and community formation, providing foundational teaching for how the messianic community should function after Jesus' ascension.

### Peter's Keys of the Kingdom

The promise to Peter in Matthew 16:17-19 appears only in Matthew: "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." This unique logion addresses Peter's foundational role, the church's establishment, its invincibility against hell, and apostolic authority in binding and loosing. While disputed interpretatively (whether "this rock" refers to Peter personally, his confession, or Christ), the passage's exclusivity to Matthew demonstrates this Gospel's unique ecclesiological emphases.

### The Temple Tax

Matthew alone records the incident where Jesus instructs Peter to catch a fish containing a coin to pay the temple tax for both of them (Matthew 17:24-27). This unique miracle demonstrates Jesus' divine knowledge and His submission to legitimate authorities even while technically exempt.

### The Transfiguration Cloud Voice

While all Synoptics include the Transfiguration, only Matthew records the divine voice adding "listen to him" (Matthew 17:5), echoing Deuteronomy 18:15 about the prophet like Moses whom Israel must obey. This unique addition reinforces Matthew's presentation of Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words demand obedient response.

### Saints Rising at Jesus' Death

Matthew uniquely records that at Jesus' death, "the tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many" (Matthew 27:52-53). This enigmatic passage, appearing nowhere else in Scripture, demonstrates the cosmic significance of Jesus' death and its power over death itself.

### The Guard at the Tomb

Only Matthew records that Jewish leaders requested Pilate to secure the tomb with guards (Matthew 27:62-66), the earthquake and angelic stone-rolling at the resurrection (Matthew 28:2-4), and the guards' report to the chief priests followed by their being bribed to spread the false story that disciples stole the body (Matthew 28:11-15). These unique details address Jewish objections to the resurrection and demonstrate that Jesus' tomb was indeed empty.

## Textual Variants

Matthew's Gospel survives in more ancient hand-written copies than almost any other ancient text. The earliest fragments, written on papyrus (an ancient paper made from reeds), date to the second and third centuries—within 100-200 years of when Matthew was originally written. Some notable early fragments include P77/P103 (dated 125-150 CE, containing small portions of Matthew 23-26), P64/67 (around 200 CE, with pieces of Matthew 3, 5, and 26), and P1 (early 200s CE, preserving Matthew chapter 1). Scholars have identified over a dozen such papyrus fragments of Matthew.

We also have five major handwritten copies of Matthew from the 300s-400s CE written in large, formal lettering called "uncial" script. [Codex Sinaiticus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Codex-Sinaiticus) and [Codex Vaticanus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Codex-Vaticanus) (both from the 300s CE) contain the entire New Testament. Three other important copies—[Codex Alexandrinus](https://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2021/01/codex-alexandrinus-index.html), [Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus](https://christianpublishinghouse.co/2022/06/16/codex-ephraemi-rescriptus-fifth-century-c-e-greek-new-testament-manuscript/), and [Codex Bezae](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Codex-Bezae) (all from the 400s CE)—also preserve Matthew's text.

Additionally, hundreds of later manuscripts (written in smaller "minuscule" script), church lectionaries (books with Scripture readings for worship services), ancient translations into Latin, Syriac, and Coptic languages, and quotations from early church fathers all help scholars establish what Matthew originally wrote. This wealth of early evidence, spanning from the second to fifth centuries, gives textual scholars great confidence in reconstructing Matthew's original text.

### Minor Name Variations in the Genealogy (Matthew 1:3)

The genealogy in Matthew 1 contains several **minor textual variants in names**. Matthew 1:3 shows variation between "Ζαρε" (P1 and Vaticanus) and "Ζαρα" (later manuscripts), both referring to Zerah. Matthew 1:10 shows early witnesses attesting "Ἀμώς" (Amos) rather than the historically correct "Ἀμών" (Amon), suggesting confusion between similar Hebrew names during Greek transmission. These minor variants in proper nouns illustrate common transcriptional variations that do not affect meaning or doctrine but reflect the challenges of transliterating Hebrew names into Greek. ([Source](https://uncommonpursuit.net/matthews-genealogy-of-jesus/))

### The Virgin Birth in the Genealogy (Matthew 1:16)

Matthew's genealogy concludes with **unusual phrasing that breaks the pattern maintained throughout**, whereas previous verses state "A begot B", Matthew 1:16 reads "Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus." The Greek relative pronoun (ἧς, "of whom") is unambiguously feminine singular, pointing exclusively to Mary as Jesus' biological parent and implying the virgin birth. However, the Sinaitic Syriac manuscript (fifth century palimpsest) contains the variant: 

> Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, begot Jesus who is called the Christ.

This reading appears self-contradictory (calling Mary "virgin" while stating Joseph "begot" Jesus) and is found only in this single Syriac witness. Raymond Brown and other scholars note this variant arose not to deny the virgin birth but likely reflects later debates over Mary's perpetual virginity. The overwhelming manuscript support for the standard reading, combined with its clear alignment with Matthew's virgin birth narrative (Matthew 1:18-25), establishes the original text as supporting the doctrine. This variant demonstrates that even early centuries witnessed attempts to harmonize or clarify perceived difficulties, though such attempts found minimal acceptance in manuscript tradition. ([Source](https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/commentaries/IVP-NT/Matthew/Matt.1.1-17))

### The Lord's Prayer Doxology (Matthew 6:13)

The most widely known textual variant in Matthew concerns the doxological conclusion to the Lord's Prayer: 

> For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen

> ὅτι σοῦ ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ἀμήν

This conclusion is **absent from the oldest and best manuscripts** including Sinaiticus (original hand), Vaticanus, Ephraemi Rescriptus, along with the majority of Old Latin witnesses, the Vulgate, Coptic versions, and early patristic witnesses. The doxology appears in the Didache (c. 70-130 CE) in a slightly shorter form (lacking "the kingdom"), suggesting early liturgical usage independent of Matthew's Gospel. Later Byzantine manuscripts include the full doxology, which entered the Textus Receptus and thus the King James Version. Most scholars conclude the doxology represents a liturgical addition "to adapt the Prayer for liturgical use in the early church" (Bruce Metzger) rather than original Matthean text. ([Source](https://www.gotquestions.org/for-thine-is-the-kingdom.html)) 

Modern critical editions (NA28, UBS5) omit the doxology from the main text, though some editions include it in brackets. The UBS gives this variant a "C" rating (considerable doubt). Conservative scholarship generally accepts its secondary status while recognizing its ancient liturgical usage and theological appropriateness.

### The Weather Signs (Matthew 16:2b-3)

When Pharisees and Sadducees request a sign, some manuscripts include Jesus' response: 

> When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.

This passage is **absent from the most ancient uncials Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, Codex X, manuscripts** known to Origen and Jerome, and some Peshitta and Coptic versions. The passage appears in Codices C, D, L, and W, and the majority of later Byzantine manuscripts. Scholars have debated this variant since the nineteenth century. Those favoring omission note the absence from earliest witnesses and suggest the passage represents insertion from a source similar to Luke 12:54-56 or from Luke itself. Frederick Scrivener and M.-J. Lagrange, however, argued the passage was omitted by copyists in climates (particularly Egypt, where Vaticanus and Sinaiticus originated) where red morning sky does not predict rain, making Jesus' illustration contextually inappropriate. The UBS gives inclusion a "C" rating (considerable doubt) and modern critical editions typically include the passage in brackets, indicating uncertainty. This variant demonstrates how geographical and cultural factors may have influenced textual transmission. ([Source](https://www.uasvbible.org/texts/display/2001/Matthew/16))

### Barabbas's Full Name (Matthew 27:16-17)

Some manuscripts identify the prisoner as "Jesus Barabbas" rather than simply "Barabbas," making Pilate's question more pointed: 

> "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"

Several early witnesses support the longer reading, though it was dropped from most manuscripts, possibly because copyists found it theologically objectionable to apply Jesus' name to the criminal. If original, the detail intensifies the irony: Israel chooses Jesus-who-is-a-criminal over Jesus-who-is-Messiah. ([Source](https://www.tyndalehouse.com/explore/articles/what-was-barabbas-first-name/))

### The Spear Thrust (Matthew 27:49)

After recording the giving of sour wine to Jesus on the cross, some manuscripts add: 

> And another took a spear and pierced his side, and there came out water and blood 

> ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἔνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευρὰν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὕδωρ καὶ αἷμα

This reading appears in significant early witnesses including Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Codices C, L, and U, approximately 35 minuscule manuscripts, some Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts (including the Book of Kells), Aramaic, Ethiopic, and Middle Egyptian versions. The passage closely parallels John 19:34, sharing vocabulary ("spear," "pierce," "side," "water and blood"). Despite this impressive early manuscript support, most scholars regard the reading as secondary for several reasons: 

1. it creates a chronological problem, suggesting Jesus was pierced before death rather than after as John explicitly states; 
2. the verbal similarity to John suggests assimilation from John's Gospel; 
3. Matthew elsewhere shows no knowledge of this detail; 
4. the majority of manuscripts lack the addition. This variant illustrates how early scribes sometimes harmonized Gospel accounts, incorporating details from one Gospel into parallel passages in another. Modern critical editions omit this addition from Matthew's text. ([Source](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/27.htm))

### The Great Commission Formula (Matthew 28:19)

While all Gospels end with resurrection appearances and commissioning, Matthew's version (Matthew 28:19) includes what became known as [the Trinitarian baptismal formula](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity/baptism-formula): "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." However, this phrase is questioned as a [textual variation](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity/baptism-formula) by some scholars based on manuscript evidence: early Church Fathers like [Eusebius and Justin Martyr never quoted this trinitarian phrase](http://godskingdomfirst.org/Commission.htm), and the apostolic practice throughout Acts consistently shows baptism "in the name of Jesus" only (Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, 19:5).

Despite questions about its originality, this commission became the basis for Christian missionary practice and baptismal liturgy throughout church history. 

## Textual Errors

Critics have alleged that Matthew's Gospel contains factual, historical, and prophetic errors that undermine its claim to divine inspiration. These alleged errors range from misattributed prophecies and botanical inaccuracies to historical contradictions and unfulfilled citations. Conservative evangelical scholarship responds that careful examination of context, ancient literary conventions, cultural background, and linguistic analysis resolves these difficulties, demonstrating that alleged "errors" reflect modern misunderstanding rather than ancient mistakes. The following addresses the most commonly cited examples:

### Genealogical Differences from Luke (Matthew 1:1-17)

Matthew's genealogy (Matthew 1:1-17) differs significantly from Luke's (Luke 3:23-38). Both agree from Abraham to David but **diverge** afterward: 

Matthew traces descent through Solomon, Luke through Nathan (both David's sons). Matthew names Jacob as Joseph's father (Matthew 1:16), Luke names Heli (Luke 3:23). Matthew lists 28 generations from David to Jesus, Luke lists 41. Critics claim these *genealogies contradict*, proving at least one erroneous. 

Traditional conservative explanation maintains Matthew provides Jesus' **legal, royal lineage** through Joseph (establishing legal claim to David's throne), while Luke provides Jesus' **biological lineage through Mary** (explaining His physical Davidic descent). If "Joseph son of Heli" follows ancient levirate marriage custom or represents Joseph as Heli's son-in-law (Mary's father being Heli), the genealogies trace different lines converging in Jesus. Matthew emphasizes Jesus' legal right to kingship (through Solomon's royal line), Luke emphasizes Jesus' physical descent from David (through Nathan). 

Both serve theological purposes: 
* Matthew addresses Jewish concerns about messianic credentials, 
* Luke demonstrates Jesus' true humanity and universal significance (tracing back to Adam). 

Rather than errors, the genealogies reflect different purposes, audiences, and lines of descent, demonstrating complementary rather than contradictory testimony.

### The Birth Chronology (Matthew 2:1)

> Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea **in the days of Herod the king**, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem... — Matthew 2:1 (ESV)

Matthew places Jesus' birth during Herod the Great's reign, who died in 4 BCE. Luke associates Jesus' birth with Quirinius' census, occurring in 6 CE.

> This was *the first* registration **when Quirinius was governor** of Syria. — Luke 2:2 (ESV)

 Critics claim this *10 year discrepancy* proves at least one Gospel erroneous. Most scholars acknowledge Luke presents greater chronological difficulty (census requiring return to ancestral towns, census allegedly applying to Galilee when Quirinius governed only Judea, etc.). 
 
 Conservative responses include: 
 1. Archaeological evidence (Lapis Tiburtinus inscription, though incomplete) suggests Quirinius **may have governed Syria twice**:  once around 4-1 BCE (during Herod's reign) and again in 6 CE, with Luke referring to the earlier census. 
 2. The Greek *prōtē* (Luke 2:2) **could mean "before" rather than "first"**, rendering "this census took place *before* Quirinius was governor of Syria," resolving the difficulty entirely. 
 3. Census enrollments often took years to complete; **a census initiated during Herod's reign may have extended into Quirinius' governorship**.
 
 Matthew's account contains firmer chronological anchors (Herod's massacre, death, Archelaus' succession), while Luke's census reference may be approximate or refer to regional enrollment preceding the formal 6 CE census. While uncertainty persists, conservative scholarship maintains the difficulty resides more in Luke than Matthew, and solutions remain historically plausible pending additional archaeological evidence. The objection does not establish demonstrable error in Matthew's dating.

### The Nazarene Prophecy (Matthew 2:23)

Matthew concludes his infancy narrative stating:

> And he [Jesus] went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that **what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene**. — Matthew 2:23 (ESV)

No such quotation exists in the Old Testament, leading skeptics to claim *Matthew fabricated a prophecy or erred in his citation*. 

Several explanations resolve this difficulty:

1. Matthew uses the plural "prophets" rather than his usual singular "prophet," suggesting he references a **general prophetic theme** rather than a specific text. 
2. "Nazarene" (Ναζωραῖος) likely connects to the Hebrew *netser* (נֵצֶר, "branch" or "shoot"), a messianic title appearing in Isaiah 11:1 ("a shoot from the stump of Jesse"), Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15; Zechariah 3:8, 6:12. Matthew **employs wordplay connecting** Jesus' geographical origin (Nazareth) with His messianic identity (the Branch). 
3. Many prophecies indicate the Messiah would be despised (Psalm 22:6; Isaiah 49:7, 53:3); Nazareth was proverbially despised (John 1:46: "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"), thus Jesus' Nazarene identity **fulfilled prophecies of the Messiah's humble**, rejected status. 

Matthew may reference oral prophetic traditions preserved in first-century Judaism but not included in written Scripture. Rather than error, Matthew demonstrates sophisticated theological reflection connecting geography, etymology, and messianic prophecy.

### The Mustard Seed Statement (Matthew 13:31-32)

> He [Jesus] put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is **the smallest of all seeds**, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.” — Matthew 13:31-32 (ESV)

Critics note *the mustard seed is not botanically the smallest seed*, for example orchid seeds, petunia seeds, and others are smaller. This allegedly demonstrates *factual error*. 

Conservative responses recognize Jesus spoke within cultural-agricultural context, not as a modern botanist. 

1. Jesus **addressed Jewish farmers** familiar with commonly cultivated seeds (wheat, barley, lentils, beans); among agricultural seeds in first-century Israel, mustard was proverbially the smallest. 
2. Jesus employed proverbial language; "smallest seed" was a common **Jewish idiom** (found in Talmudic literature) expressing minuteness, similar to modern "needle in a haystack" (not claiming needles exist only in haystacks). 

Jesus used phenomenological language (describing appearances and common perceptions) rather than technical scientific description, a distinction hermeneutically essential for understanding ancient texts. To charge Jesus with error for using proverbial agricultural language reflects anachronistic imposition of modern scientific standards onto ancient rhetorical communication.

### The Attribution to Jeremiah (Matthew 27:9-10)

Matthew states that Judas' betrayal for thirty pieces of silver fulfilled "what **was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet," yet the most obvious source is Zechariah 11:12-13**, which mentions thirty pieces of silver and a potter. Critics claim this represents a clear factual error—Matthew misattributed a Zechariah prophecy to Jeremiah. 

Conservative scholars offer several explanations: 

1. Only Jeremiah mentions the "field" of the potter, the principal element in Matthew's quotation and Matthew combined this prophecy with Zechariah, blending imagery from Jeremiah 19:1-11 (potter's field and valley) and Jeremiah 32:6-9 (purchasing a field) with the monetary detail from Zechariah 11:12-13.
2. Some scholars suggest Matthew had access to now-lost portions of Jeremiah or alternate textual traditions. 

While Jerome and Augustine acknowledged difficulty with this passage, conservative scholarship maintains that Matthew's attribution reflects intentional composite citation rather than error.

## Contradictions

Critics frequently allege that Matthew's Gospel contains internal contradictions and irreconcilable discrepancies when compared with the other three Gospels.

Conservative scholarship responds that apparent contradictions dissolve when ancient biographical conventions, complementary rather than contradictory reporting, eyewitness perspective differences, literary compression, and theological selectivity are properly understood. The Gospels function as ancient Greco-Roman biographies (*bios* literature), which prioritized theological interpretation and thematic arrangement over strict chronological precision, allowed paraphrase and summary, and selected material according to authorial purpose. 

Alleged contradictions typically represent different perspectives on the same events rather than mutually exclusive claims, analogous to how multiple witnesses describe the same accident from different vantage points with varying details yet consistent core facts.

### The Jeconiah Curse (Matthew 1:12 cf. Jeremiah 22:30)

Matthew's **genealogy traces Jesus through Jeconiah** (Matthew 1:12): "and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel..."

However, Jeremiah prophesied a curse against Jeconiah (also called Coniah or Jehoiachin):

> Thus says the LORD: "Write this man down as **childless**, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah." — Jeremiah 22:30 (ESV)

Critics argue Matthew's inclusion of the cursed Jeconiah in Jesus' genealogy creates an insurmountable problem: if Jesus descends from Jeconiah, he falls under the curse and cannot legitimately sit on David's throne.

Conservative responses include:

1. **"Childless" means without royal successor**: The prophecy was fulfilled—none of Jeconiah's descendants actually reigned as king in Judah. While Jeconiah had biological children (1 Chronicles 3:17-18), no offspring sat on David's throne in Jerusalem during the exile or after.

2. **The curse was conditionally lifted**: Jeconiah repented in exile (2 Kings 25:27-30 records his release and honor in Babylon). God's promise to Zerubbabel, Jeconiah's grandson (Haggai 2:23), suggests the curse was lifted based on repentance.

3. **Legal vs. biological lineage**: Matthew traces Jesus' legal right through Joseph (who descended from Jeconiah), while Luke 3:23-38 traces biological descent through Mary (through Nathan, not Solomon, thus avoiding Jeconiah entirely). Jesus inherits the legal claim to David's throne through Joseph without being biologically under the curse.

4. **Messiah as exception**: The curse applied to human monarchy in fallen Israel; Jesus' eternal kingship, established by divine decree and resurrection, transcends and supersedes the temporal curse on Jeconiah's earthly dynasty.

While the curse presents a genuine exegetical challenge, conservative scholarship maintains that Matthew's inclusion of Jeconiah demonstrates theological sophistication rather than error, showing Jesus as the one who overcomes the curse and restores the Davidic line through divine intervention.

### The Centurion's Servant (Matthew 8:5-13 cf. Luke 7:1-10)

> When he [Jesus] had entered Capernaum, a centurion **came forward to him**, appealing... — Matthew 8:5 (ESV)

Matthew states the centurion "came forward to him" directly requesting healing, while Luke records the centurion "sent to him elders of the Jews" (Luke 7:3) and later "sent friends" (Luke 7:6). Critics claim this demonstrates *irreconcilable contradiction* because either the centurion came personally or sent intermediaries, not both. 

Conservative response invokes the ancient law of agency: emissaries acting on another's authority were legally and socially **regarded as equivalent to the principal himself acting**. Numerous biblical examples demonstrate this principle: 2 Samuel 3:18, 14:19; 2 Kings 14:27; Esther 8:8; Ezra 1:7-8. When authorized representatives speak, ancient literature attributes speech directly to the one who authorized them. Matthew employs narrative compression (telescoping), a common ancient literary technique omitting intermediary details to focus on principals; Luke, who explicitly claims thorough investigation (Luke 1:3), includes fuller circumstantial detail. Both accounts could remain historically accurate: the centurion did approach Jesus (through authorized representatives), and intermediaries were physically present. Neither Matthew nor Luke claims exclusivity contradicting the other; they simply emphasize different aspects according to their distinct purposes and audiences.

### The Triumphal Entry (Matthew 21:1-7 cf. Mark 11:1-7)

Matthew mentions both "a donkey, and a colt" (Matthew 21:2), stating the disciples "brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them" (Matthew 21:7). Mark, Luke, and John mention only the colt (Mark 11:2,7; Luke 19:30,35; John 12:14-15). Skeptics charge *Matthew invented a second animal* through misunderstanding Zechariah 9:9's Hebrew parallelism ("mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey"), failing to recognize this describes one animal from two perspectives. 

Conservative response maintains **both animals were present**: 
* Matthew, emphasizing fulfillment of Zechariah's prophecy for his Jewish audience, mentions both animals; 
* Mark, Luke, and John focus on the colt Jesus actually rode. 

Matthew does not state Jesus rode both animals simultaneously—"sat on them" likely refers to the cloaks placed on both animals rather than to both animals themselves. **The mother donkey accompanied her unbroken colt** (which "no one has ever yet sat," Mark 11:2) to calm it, **a practical consideration when riding an untrained young animal through crowds**. Matthew's dual mention reflects neither error nor misunderstanding but accurate reporting of both animals' presence combined with emphasis on prophetic fulfillment. The other Evangelists, not addressing the same Jewish apologetic concerns, mention **only the animal Jesus rode without denying another's presence**.

### The Timing of the Temple Cleansing (Matthew 21:12-13 cf. John 2:13-17)

Critics note apparent chronological contradictions: 

* Matthew places the temple cleansing during Passion Week (Matthew 21:12-13)
* John places it at the beginning of Jesus' ministry (John 2:13-17); 

Matthew records the fig tree withering "at once" (Matthew 21:19), Mark says it withered overnight with disciples noticing the next morning (Mark 11:12-14,20-21). 

Conservative responses note: 

1. Jesus **may have cleansed the temple twice** — once at ministry's beginning (John) and again during Passion Week (Synoptics), demonstrating consistent righteous zeal for His Father's house. 
2. Ancient biographies regularly **arranged material thematically rather than strictly chronologically**; none of the Gospels claims rigid chronological sequencing for every event. Matthew's compression serves theological purpose without historical fabrication, analogous to modern biographical writing that may discuss someone's "college years" topically rather than semester-by-semester chronologically.

Regarding the fig tree, **Matthew compresses the event into single narrative** for theological emphasis (immediate judgment on Israel's fruitlessness), while **Mark provides fuller chronological detail** (curse, overnight withering, morning discovery). Both remain accurate: the tree did wither "at once" (**immediately upon Jesus' curse**, though **not observed until next morning**), and disciples did observe it the following morning. 

### The Prediction of Peter's Denial (Matthew 26:34 cf. Mark 14:30)

Matthew, Luke, and John record Jesus predicting "before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times" (Matthew 26:34; Luke 22:34; John 13:38). Mark records "before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times" (Mark 14:30). Critics see contradiction: did Jesus predict **one crow or two**? 

Conservative harmonization notes **Mark provides greater precision**: Jesus predicted three denials before the rooster's second crow. If Peter denied Jesus three times before the rooster crowed twice (especially if the two crows occurred in quick succession), it remains equally true that Peter denied Him before the rooster crowed (without specifying which crow). Matthew, Luke, and John streamline to the essential point without denying **additional details**. The more detailed account includes rather than contradicts the less detailed.

### The Death of Judas (Matthew 27:3-10 cf. Acts 1:18-19)

Matthew states Judas "hanged himself" (Matthew 27:5), while Acts records he "falling headlong...burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out" (Acts 1:18). Additionally, Matthew says the chief priests bought the field with returned blood money (Matthew 27:6-7), Acts states Judas himself purchased the field (Acts 1:18). 

Conservative harmonization proposes sequential complementary accounts: Judas hanged himself (**Matthew's focus on method of suicide**), the rope or branch broke or the body decomposed, causing the corpse to fall and burst upon impact (**Luke's focus in Acts on grotesque final result**). Ancient corpses exposed to heat experience rapid decomposition and gas buildup, particularly in abdominal regions; a fall from hanging, even from moderate height, could easily cause a decomposed body to rupture as Acts describes. 

Regarding field purchase, **the priests technically bought the field**, but since **they used Judas' returned money** and **purchased it in his name** (since they could not put blood money in the temple treasury), both "the priests bought" and "Judas bought" remain true from different perspectives. This resembles modern legal language where a corporation "purchases" property though individual officers execute transactions. 

The field's name "Field of Blood" fits both accounts: **Matthew emphasizes the blood money used** to purchase it, **Acts the blood spilled** when Judas' body burst. Rather than contradiction, the accounts provide complementary perspectives on the same tragic end. 

**Matthew's version emphasizes fulfillment of prophecy** (Zechariah 11:12-13, attributed to Jeremiah in Matthew 27:9) and demonstrates the tragic consequences of betraying the Messiah.


### The Resurrection Accounts (Matthew 28:1-10)

The most frequently cited contradictions concern resurrection morning details. Critics note: 

* Matthew mentions "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary" (Matthew 28:1), 
* Mark adds Salome (Mark 16:1), 
* Luke names "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women" (Luke 24:10), 
* John focuses solely on Mary Magdalene (John 20:1). 

Regarding angels, 

* Matthew records one angel (Matthew 28:2-5), 
* Mark one young man (Mark 16:5), 
* Luke two men (Luke 24:4),
* John two angels (John 20:12). 

Conservative harmonization recognizes that none of these accounts claims exclusivity. 

Matthew and Mark **focus on the spokesperson angel** who delivered the primary message, while Luke and John **mention both angels present**. 

Regarding women, Matthew and Mark provide **abbreviated lists** while Luke offers **more complete enumeration** and John **spotlights Mary Magdalene's experience without denying others' presence**. Ancient biographical writing commonly selected details supporting authorial purpose rather than exhaustively cataloging every participant. Furthermore, **multiple women likely made multiple trips** to the tomb that morning, with **different Gospel writers focusing on different visits or different groups**. 

The core agreement remains unshaken: 

* the tomb was empty, 
* angels announced Jesus' resurrection, 
* women encountered the risen Lord, 
* disciples verified the empty tomb. 

Differences in peripheral details actually strengthen rather than undermine historical reliability because fabricated accounts typically demonstrate suspicious uniformity, while authentic independent testimony naturally varies in perspective and detail selection while agreeing on essentials.
