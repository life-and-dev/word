# Ephesians

The Epistle to the Ephesians stands as one of the most majestic and spiritually profound writings in the New Testament. It offers a sweeping vision that connects the heights of heavenly realities with the daily walk of believers on earth. This letter invites readers to explore a cosmic plan that was hidden for ages, a mystery that brings together diverse people into a single, unified body. As one delves into its chapters, the boundaries between the spiritual realm and human history begin to blur, revealing a grand design for the entire universe.

## Authorship

The authorship of Ephesians is a highly debated topic in New Testament scholarship. The epistle explicitly claims Pauline authorship (Ephesians 1:1, 3:1) and internal evidence suggests a prison setting. This leads to the traditional view of Paul writing it around AD 60 to 62 during his Roman imprisonment. Early church fathers like Polycarp, Ignatius, and Irenaeus universally attributed it to Paul. It also appears in the [Muratorian Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muratorian_fragment) (c. AD 170).

However, modern critical scholarship is divided. Many scholars view Ephesians as deutero-Pauline. This means they believe it was written by a later follower of Paul rather than the apostle himself. Arguments against Pauline authorship include significant stylistic differences. These include long and complex sentences. The letter also features a unique vocabulary with 38 hapax legomena (words that appear only once in the New Testament). Other arguments point to literary dependence on Colossians and a lack of specificity in addressing local issues. The letter also shows a more developed ecclesiology (the study or theology of the church) and eschatology (the study of final things).

Arguments for Pauline authorship highlight early universal acceptance. The letter makes explicit claims about its author. It also shows consistency with Paul's historical context and theological alignment despite some development. Surveys show a significant split among scholars with no clear consensus. If it is deutero-Pauline, it is usually dated from AD 70 to 90.

Proponents of Pauline authorship argue that the early church was very careful about authenticity. They would unlikely have accepted a pseudonymously written letter so universally if they had doubts. Some suggest that Paul may have used an amanuensis (a literary assistant or scribe) who had more stylistic freedom. This could explain the unique vocabulary and sentence structure while maintaining Pauline authority.

## Historical Environment

Ephesians was likely written as a circular letter to churches in [Asia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_(Roman_province)), including the prominent city of [Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus). It was composed either by Paul from Roman imprisonment (c. 60 to 62 AD) or by a disciple (c. 70 to 90 AD). The letter addresses a predominantly Gentile audience. Ephesus was the provincial capital. It was a major commercial hub and a center for the cult of [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) and magical practices. This created a complex religious environment. The letter's emphasis on Christ's supremacy over cosmic powers and its instructions on spiritual warfare directly counter this occult background. The central theme of unity between Jews and Gentiles in Christ addresses the primary social and theological challenge facing these new and diverse communities in the Greco-Roman world.

## Purpose

Ephesians serves multiple interconnected purposes. It blends profound theology with practical application. Unlike most of Paul's letters, which address specific local controversies, Ephesians presents a comprehensive vision of God's eternal plan and the church's role within it.

### Primary Theme: Unity in Christ

The central purpose of Ephesians is to proclaim and promote the unity of Jews and Gentiles in the one body of Christ. This theme pervades the entire letter:

**The Broken Barrier** (Ephesians 2:11-22): The author addresses Gentile believers. He reminds them that they were once "separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" (Ephesians 2:12 (ESV)). Christ's death accomplished cosmic reconciliation. It broke down "the dividing wall of hostility" between these two groups (Ephesians 2:14 (ESV)). This "wall" likely refers metaphorically to the Torah's ceremonial laws that separated Jews and Gentiles. It might also refer to the physical barrier in the Jerusalem Temple that prohibited Gentiles from entering the inner courts under penalty of death.

**One New Humanity** (Ephesians 2:15): Christ created "one new man in place of the two." This is a radically new identity that transcends ethnic, cultural, and religious divisions. This was revolutionary in the ancient world. Ethnic identity was fundamental to personal and social identity during that time.

**The Mystery Revealed** (Ephesians 3:2-6): Paul describes his special revelation regarding "the mystery of Christ." He defines it explicitly: "the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Ephesians 3:6 (ESV)). This "mystery" was God's long-hidden plan. It is now revealed that salvation extends equally to all peoples without ethnic distinction.

**Practical Unity** (Ephesians 4:1-16): The letter urges believers to "maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3 (ESV)). It emphasizes "one body and one Spirit...one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:4-6 (ESV)). The sevenfold repetition of "one" hammers home the message of Christian unity.

### Theological Purpose: Revealing God's Eternal Plan

Ephesians unfolds God's cosmic purposes across the ages:

**Predestination and Election** (Ephesians 1:3-14): The letter reveals that God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4 (ESV)). He "predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 1:5 (ESV)). This was not an afterthought. It was God's predetermined plan "for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth" (Ephesians 1:10 (ESV)).

**The Church's Cosmic Significance**: Ephesians presents the church not merely as a human organization. It is the vehicle through which God displays His wisdom "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10 (ESV)). The church itself becomes a teaching instrument for angelic beings. It demonstrates God's redemptive wisdom.

**Christ's Supremacy**: The letter establishes Christ's absolute supremacy over all cosmic powers. God seated Christ "at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion" (Ephesians 1:20-21 (ESV)). He placed "all things under his feet" (Ephesians 1:22 (ESV)). This cosmic Christology addresses believers living in a world perceived as populated by spiritual powers. This was a world where magic, astrology, and worship of various deities competed for allegiance.

### Practical Purpose: Walking Worthy

Ephesians divides naturally into two halves. The first part provides the theological foundation (chapters 1 to 3). The second part focuses on ethical application (chapters 4 to 6). The hinge comes at Ephesians 4:1: "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called" (ESV).

The word "walk" (Greek: peripateō) appears repeatedly in chapters 4 to 6. It describes various aspects of Christian conduct:

- **Walk in unity** (Ephesians 4:1-16): Living out the oneness that exists positionally.
- **Walk differently from pagans** (Ephesians 4:17-24): Putting off the old self and putting on the new.
- **Walk in love** (Ephesians 5:1-7): Imitating God as beloved children.
- **Walk as children of light** (Ephesians 5:8-14): Living in moral clarity.
- **Walk carefully** (Ephesians 5:15-21): Living wisely and understanding God's will.
- **Walk in ordered relationships** (Ephesians 5:21, 6:9): Applying Christian principles to household relationships.

The letter addresses specific behavioral concerns. These would have been particularly relevant for Gentile converts coming from pagan backgrounds:

- **Moral purity** (Ephesians 4:17, 5:14): Rejecting sexual immorality, impurity, covetousness, filthy talk, and crude joking.
- **Truthfulness** (Ephesians 4:25): Putting away falsehood and speaking truth.
- **Controlled anger** (Ephesians 4:26-27): Managing anger without giving opportunity to the devil.
- **Honest labor** (Ephesians 4:28): Working honestly rather than stealing.
- **Edifying speech** (Ephesians 4:29): Using words to build up rather than tear down.

### Ecclesiological Purpose: Elevating the Church

Ephesians presents the highest view of the church found anywhere in Scripture:

**The Church as Christ's Body** (Ephesians 1:22-23): Christ is "head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all" (ESV). The church is not merely Christ's organization. It is His very fullness. It is the means by which He fills everything.

**The Church as God's Building** (Ephesians 2:19-22): Believers are "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone" (ESV). They are "built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit" (ESV). The church is God's temple. It is His dwelling place on earth.

**The Church as Christ's Bride** (Ephesians 5:25-32): Christ "loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her...that he might present the church to himself in splendor" (ESV). The marriage relationship becomes a profound picture of Christ's relationship with His church.

This exalted ecclesiology serves to remind believers of their corporate identity and significance. Christians formed a tiny and sometimes persecuted minority in that world. Ephesians assures them that they belong to an entity of cosmic importance.

### Spiritual Warfare Purpose

Uniquely among Paul's letters, Ephesians emphasizes spiritual warfare as an ongoing reality for believers. The letter's closing section (Ephesians 6:10-20) describes the Christian life as warfare "against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12 (ESV)).

This emphasis would have resonated particularly with Ephesian believers. The city was known as a center of magical practices. The letter provides an alternative paradigm. Rather than manipulating spiritual powers through magic, believers resist evil spiritual forces through truth, righteousness, and the gospel of peace. They also use faith, salvation, God's word, and prayer.

### Pastoral Purpose: Strengthening Faith

The letter aims to strengthen believers' faith. It deepens their understanding of their identity in Christ. Paul's prayers in Ephesians 1:15-23 and 3:14-21 reveal these pastoral concerns:

**That believers might know**:
- "What is the hope to which he has called you"
- "What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints"
- "What is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe" (Ephesians 1:18-19 (ESV))

**That believers might be**:
- "Strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being"
- Able "to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth"
- Able "to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge"
- "Filled with all the fullness of God" (Ephesians 3:16-19 (ESV))

These prayers reflect the letter's purpose. It does not merely inform but transforms. It moves believers from intellectual knowledge to an experiential understanding of God's love and power.

### Summary of Purposes

Ephesians was written to:

1. **Proclaim** the unity of Jews and Gentiles in Christ's body, breaking down ancient ethnic barriers.
2. **Reveal** God's eternal plan to unite all things in Christ through the church.
3. **Establish** Christ's supremacy over all cosmic powers.
4. **Teach** believers how to live worthy of their calling in Christ.
5. **Elevate** believers' understanding of the church's significance.
6. **Equip** believers for spiritual warfare against evil powers.
7. **Strengthen** believers' faith and deepen their experiential knowledge of God's love.
8. **Transform** behavior, particularly addressing issues relevant to Gentile converts from paganism.
9. **Preserve** and apply apostolic teaching for the church.

The letter addresses the whole person. This includes the mind, will, and heart. It provides both a doctrinal foundation and practical application for Christian life. Its purpose is simultaneously theological, ethical, pastoral, and spiritual. This makes it one of the most comprehensive statements of Christian belief and practice in the New Testament.

## Cross-References

Ephesians both draws upon earlier Scripture and influences later New Testament writings. This creates a rich web of intertextual connections that illuminate its theological significance.

### Old Testament Quotations in Ephesians

Ephesians explicitly quotes the Old Testament several times. This happens notably less frequently than in some other Pauline letters like Romans or Galatians:

**Psalm 68:18 in Ephesians 4:8**

The most discussed Old Testament quotation appears in Ephesians 4:8: "Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.'" (ESV). This quotes or alludes to Psalm 68:18. In the Hebrew, this reads: "You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men." (ESV). The significant difference between "receiving" and "giving" has generated scholarly discussion. The author may be following the Aramaic Targum tradition. This interprets the psalm as God receiving tribute in order to distribute it as gifts. Paul applies this victory imagery to Christ's ascension and His giving of spiritual gifts to the church.

**Genesis 2:24 in Ephesians 5:31**

Ephesians 5:31 quotes Genesis 2:24 in its discussion of marriage: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." (ESV). This foundational text about marriage is then interpreted mystically: "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32 (ESV)). This elevates the marriage union to a picture of Christ's relationship with His bride.

**Exodus 20:12 in Ephesians 6:2-3**

The fifth commandment is quoted in Ephesians 6:2-3: "Honor your father and mother (this is the first commandment with a promise), that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." (ESV). Notably, Ephesians quotes from Deuteronomy 5:16's version of the commandment. This includes the phrase "that it may go well with you," which is absent from Exodus 20:12.

**Isaiah 60:1 in Ephesians 5:14**

Ephesians 5:14 introduces a quotation with "Therefore it says": "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." (ESV). No exact Old Testament passage matches this quotation. Isaiah 60:1 comes closest: "Arise, shine, for your light has come." (ESV). However, the differences are substantial. Most scholars conclude this quotes either an early Christian hymn or a conflation of multiple Old Testament passages. These could include Isaiah 26:19, 51:17, 52:1, and 60:1. It might also come from a lost apocryphal source.

### Old Testament Allusions in Ephesians

Beyond direct quotations, Ephesians contains numerous allusions to Old Testament texts:

**Psalm 110:1** is referenced in Ephesians 1:20, 2:6. These describe Christ seated at God's right hand. This is the key image of Psalm 110:1: "The LORD says to my LORD: 'Sit at my right hand.'" (ESV). This psalm is the most quoted or alluded to Old Testament text in the New Testament. It appears throughout early Christian writings to demonstrate Christ's exaltation and messianic identity.

**Creation Language**: Ephesians 2:10 echoes Genesis creation language. It states: "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works" (ESV). This presents believers as God's new creation.

**Temple Imagery**: Ephesians 2:19-22 describes the church as God's temple with Christ as the cornerstone. This alludes to Isaiah 28:16: "Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone" (ESV). It also alludes to other temple-building passages.

**Armor of God**: Ephesians 6:14, 17 draws heavily on Isaiah 59:17: "He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing" (ESV). This transforms divine warrior imagery into Christian spiritual warfare equipment.

### Extensive Parallels with Colossians

The most striking feature of Ephesians' cross-references is its extraordinary literary relationship with Colossians. Of the 155 verses in Ephesians, approximately 73 to 75 show verbal parallels with Colossians. This represents nearly half the epistle. It has led most scholars to conclude that Paul wrote both letters simultaneously. Alternatively, the author of Ephesians may have used Colossians as a source or both letters depend on a common earlier source.

**Specific Verbal Parallels:**

Some passages show remarkably close wording:

- **Ephesians 6:21-22 and Colossians 4:7-8**: These verses are virtually identical in Greek. They describe Tychicus as the letter bearer.
- **Colossians 1:1-2 and Ephesians 1:1-2**: Both openings contain seven consecutive identical words.
- **Colossians 1:26 and Ephesians 3:9**: There are seven consecutive identical words discussing "the mystery."
- **Colossians 1:14 and Ephesians 1:7**: Five consecutive identical words about redemption.
- **Colossians 2:5 and Ephesians 4:16**: Five consecutive identical words are used.

**Thematic Parallels:**

Beyond verbal similarities, the letters share structural and thematic parallels:

| **Theme** | **Colossians** | **Ephesians** |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Christ as head of the body | 1:18, 24 | 1:22-23; 4:15; 5:23 |
| The mystery revealed | 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3 | 1:9; 3:3-6, 9; 5:32; 6:19 |
| Putting off/putting on | 3:8-14 | 4:22-32 |
| Wives submit to husbands | 3:18 | 5:22-24 |
| Husbands love wives | 3:19 | 5:25-33 |
| Children obey parents | 3:20 | 6:1-3 |
| Fathers and children | 3:21 | 6:4 |
| Slaves and masters | 3:22-4:1 | 6:5-9 |
| Prayer requests | 4:2-4 | 6:18-20 |
| Tychicus as messenger | 4:7-8 | 6:21-22 |

**Key Differences in Treatment:**

While covering similar ground, Ephesians often expands themes treated more briefly in Colossians:

- **Colossians 1:21-22 (2 verses)** on reconciliation becomes **Ephesians 2:11-22 (12 verses)**. This extensively develops the theme of unity between Jews and Gentiles.
- **Colossians' household code (3:18-4:1, 15 verses)** becomes **Ephesians' expanded treatment (5:21-6:9, 33 verses)**. It particularly elaborates on the husband-wife relationship with imagery of Christ and the church.
- **The "mystery"** in Colossians is primarily Christ himself (Colossians 1:27). In Ephesians, it is specifically the inclusion of Gentiles as fellow heirs (Ephesians 3:6).

### References to Ephesians in Other New Testament Books

Ephesians is rarely explicitly quoted by later New Testament writers. This is unlike some Old Testament books. However, some scholars detect possible allusions in other writings.

**1 Peter**

First Peter shares numerous themes and some verbal parallels with Ephesians. Both contain household codes with similar structure and content (Ephesians 5:21-6:9; 1 Peter 2:18-3:7). Both describe believers as a spiritual house or temple (Ephesians 2:19-22; 1 Peter 2:4-5). Both emphasize putting off the old self and being renewed (Ephesians 4:22-24; 1 Peter 1:14-16). They also both speak of Christ's preaching to spirits (Ephesians 4:8-10; 1 Peter 3:19).

Many scholars conclude that 1 Peter utilized Ephesians. The direction of influence is still debated. Peter does not compartmentalize his thought as well as Paul does. Romans and Ephesians are the two books on which Peter most heavily relies.

**2 Peter**

Second Peter 3:15-16 mentions that Paul wrote according to the wisdom given him. This likely refers to letters circulating in Asia Minor. These would include Colossians and possibly Ephesians. Some scholars believe 2 Peter demonstrates awareness of Ephesians.

**The Pastoral Epistles**

First and Second Timothy and Titus share theological emphases with Ephesians. These include church order and the role of apostles and prophets. They also share the concept of "sound doctrine." There is an emphasis on God's plan "before the ages began" (2 Timothy 1:9 (ESV); compare Ephesians 1:4 (ESV)). Similar ethical instructions are also present. These parallels may indicate common authorship, use of common traditions, or literary dependence.

### Early Church Fathers

Early church fathers extensively quoted and alluded to Ephesians. This demonstrated its early acceptance and influence.

**Ignatius of Antioch** (c. AD 105 to 115) references Ephesians multiple times. This includes his letter to the Ephesians. He makes allusions to Ephesians 5:25-27 regarding Christ's love for the church.

**Polycarp** (c. AD 110 to 140) quotes Ephesians 2:8-9 in his Letter to the Philippians. He explicitly identifies it as Scripture.

**Clement of Rome** (c. AD 96) shows familiarity with Ephesian themes. Direct quotations are harder to identify.

**The Muratorian Canon** (c. AD 170) lists Ephesians among Paul's authentic letters without question.

### Statistical Overview

**Ephesians' Use of the Old Testament:**
- Direct quotations: 4 to 5 (depending on classification).
- Significant allusions: 15 to 20 (estimates vary).
- Verbal echoes and phraseology: numerous.

Compared to Romans (60+ OT quotations) or Galatians (10+ quotations), Ephesians quotes the Old Testament sparingly. It focuses more on applying theological principles than defending them through Scripture citation.

**Ephesians' Influence on Other NT Books:**
Ephesians is rarely explicitly quoted by other New Testament writers. Its primary influence appears through theological concepts adopted by later writers. It also influenced liturgical and hymnic material shared with other traditions. Household codes in Ephesians are paralleled in 1 Peter and the Pastoral Epistles.

The rich tapestry of cross-references in Ephesians demonstrates its rootedness in Jewish Scripture. It also shows its role in developing Christian theology, particularly ecclesiology and ethics, for the early church.

## Canonical Status

Ephesians enjoys one of the strongest canonical statuses of any New Testament book. It was universally accepted as authoritative Scripture from the earliest period. This stands in contrast to several other epistles that faced questions in the early church.

### Early and Universal Acceptance

From the beginning of the second century onward, Ephesians appears in every major list of canonical New Testament books. It is never mentioned among disputed writings. This is different from books like Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation. Those books faced varying degrees of questioning in the early centuries.

### Testimony of Early Church Fathers

The earliest Christian writers after the apostolic age demonstrate clear knowledge of Ephesians.

**Clement of Rome** (c. AD 96) shows familiarity with Ephesian theology in his *First Epistle to the Corinthians*. He possibly quotes or alludes to the letter. This represents potential evidence within a decade or two of Ephesians' composition.

**Ignatius of Antioch** (c. AD 105 to 115) explicitly addresses a letter "To the Ephesians." He makes clear allusions to Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. Ignatius references concepts and language from Ephesians 5:25-27 about Christ's love for the church. His writings demonstrate that Ephesians was considered authoritative in Syria within a generation of its writing.

**Polycarp of Smyrna** (c. AD 110 to 140) was a disciple of the Apostle John. He quotes Ephesians 2:8-9 in his *Letter to the Philippians* (1:3). Significantly, Polycarp treats this as authoritative Scripture. This testimony is particularly weighty given Polycarp's direct connection to the apostolic generation. His acceptance of Ephesians as Scripture represents a bridge between the apostles and the second-century church.

**Hermas** (c. AD 140 to 155) may allude to Ephesian themes in *The Shepherd*.

**Justin Martyr** (c. AD 150 to 160) shows knowledge of Ephesians in his writings. Distinct references to the epistle appear in his works.

**Marcion's Canon** (c. AD 140): Even the heretic Marcion included "Laodiceans" in his list. Scholars generally identify this as Ephesians. This indicates that even those who edited the canon found Ephesians too central to exclude.

### Early Canonical Lists

**The Muratorian Fragment** (c. AD 170 to 200): This oldest surviving list of New Testament books explicitly includes Ephesians among Paul's authentic letters. The fragment states that Paul wrote to seven churches. Ephesians appears in this list without qualification or doubt.

**Eusebius of Caesarea** (*Ecclesiastical History*, c. AD 325): Eusebius categorized New Testament books into three groups. The first group consisted of universally acknowledged books (*homologoumena*). The second group was disputed books (*antilegomena*). The third group included spurious or heretical books (*notha*). Ephesians appears in the first category alongside the four Gospels, Acts, and Paul's major letters. Eusebius notes no controversy regarding Ephesians.

**The Cheltenham Canon** (c. AD 360): Lists Ephesians among the canonical letters of Paul.

**Athanasius' Festal Letter** (AD 367): The bishop of Alexandria provides the earliest complete list of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Ephesians is included without comment as obviously canonical.

**The Councils of Hippo** (AD 393) and **Carthage** (AD 397): These North African councils formalized the New Testament canon. They included Ephesians without debate.

### Manuscript Evidence

The manuscript tradition provides strong support for Ephesians' early acceptance.

**Papyrus 46** (P46, c. AD 200): This is one of the earliest substantial New Testament manuscripts. It contains Ephesians in full. This demonstrates that the letter was considered important enough to include in an early collection of Paul's epistles.

**Codex Sinaiticus** (א, 4th century): Contains Ephesians as part of the Pauline corpus.

**Codex Vaticanus** (B, 4th century): Includes Ephesians without any marginal notes questioning its status.

**Codex Alexandrinus** (A, 5th century): Contains Ephesians.

The consistent presence of Ephesians in all major early manuscripts indicates its undisputed canonical status.

### Reasons for Acceptance

Several factors explain Ephesians' universal canonical status:

**1. Apostolic Authorship**: The letter explicitly claims to be from Paul (Ephesians 1:1). In the ancient church, apostolic connection was the primary criterion for canonicity. Whether Paul wrote Ephesians personally or a close associate wrote it in his name, the early church attributed it to Paul.

**2. Early and Widespread Use**: From the early second century, Ephesians was used across diverse geographical regions. This includes Rome, Syria, Asia Minor, and North Africa. This indicates the letter circulated broadly and was valued universally.

**3. Theological Orthodoxy**: Ephesians' teaching aligned with emerging orthodox Christian theology. Its high Christology and emphasis on grace supported the apostolic faith. No heretical groups claimed Ephesians as supporting their positions.

**4. Liturgical Use**: Evidence suggests Ephesians was used in Christian worship and instruction from early times. Passages like Ephesians 5:14 ("Awake, O sleeper") may derive from baptismal liturgies.

**5. Lack of Controversial Content**: Unlike some other books, Ephesians contained nothing that raised concerns for early Christian communities.

### No Canonical Disputes Across Christian Traditions

Remarkably, Ephesians is accepted across all major Christian traditions without exception. This includes Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Protestant churches. No Christian tradition excludes or questions Ephesians.

### Modern Scholarly Acceptance

While modern critical scholars debate Pauline authorship, this question is separate from canonical status. Even scholars who conclude Ephesians is deutero-Pauline do not question its canonical status. The canonical question concerns whether a book functions authoritatively for the church.

The Society of Biblical Literature and scholarly commentaries treat Ephesians as canonical New Testament Scripture. The letter's theological richness and influence secure its canonical significance.

### Why This Matters

The strong canonical status of Ephesians matters for several reasons. It provides confidence in its authenticity as representing apostolic-era Christianity. It also allows Christians across traditions to appeal to its teaching with confidence. The excellent manuscript tradition reflects its valued status and gives confidence in the reliability of its text.

In summary, Ephesians stands as one of the most securely canonical books in the New Testament. It was attested from the earliest periods and accepted universally across all Christian traditions.

## Summary

Ephesians presents a majestic vision of God's eternal plan to unite all things in Christ through the church. Unlike many biblical books containing direct divine speeches, Ephesians is an apostolic letter. It contains Paul's Spirit-inspired teaching about God's revelation. The entire letter constitutes authoritative Christian doctrine about God's purposes. It explains and applies divine truth revealed through Christ and the apostles.

### Chapter 1: Spiritual Blessings in Christ and Prayer for Wisdom (Ephesians 1:1-23)

**Greeting (Ephesians 1:1-2)**: Paul identifies himself as "an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God" (ESV). He addresses "the saints who are [in Ephesus] and are faithful in Christ Jesus" (ESV). He offers grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**Spiritual Blessings (Ephesians 1:3-14)**: The letter opens with one of the New Testament's most magnificent theological statements. Paul blesses "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (ESV). He notes that God has blessed believers in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Ephesians 1:4 (ESV)). This predestination occurred before creation. It grounds salvation in God's eternal purpose rather than human merit. God "predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 1:5 (ESV)). This was "according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace" (Ephesians 1:5-6 (ESV)).

"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace" (Ephesians 1:7 (ESV)). Redemption comes through Christ's blood. This emphasizes the costliness of salvation.

God "made known to us the mystery of his will" (Ephesians 1:9 (ESV)). This was "according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth" (Ephesians 1:9-10 (ESV)). The "mystery" is God's previously hidden plan for cosmic unity through Christ.

Believers "have obtained an inheritance" (ESV). They were "sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it" (Ephesians 1:11-14 (ESV)). The Holy Spirit functions as a down payment and guarantee of future complete redemption.

**Paul's Prayer (Ephesians 1:15-23)**: Paul prays continually for the recipients after hearing of their "faith in the Lord Jesus" and "love toward all the saints" (Ephesians 1:15 (ESV)). He asks that God "give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened" (Ephesians 1:17-18 (ESV)).

Paul's prayer has three specific requests. He asks that they know "what is the hope to which he has called you" (ESV). He also asks that they know "what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints" (ESV). Finally, he asks that they know "what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe" (Ephesians 1:18-19 (ESV)).

This power is "the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead" (Ephesians 1:20 (ESV)). God seated Him "at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion" (Ephesians 1:20-21 (ESV)). God "put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church" (Ephesians 1:22 (ESV)). The church is "his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all" (Ephesians 1:23 (ESV)).

### Chapter 2: From Death to Life, From Division to Unity (Ephesians 2:1-22)

**Dead in Sin (Ephesians 2:1-3)**: Paul reminds readers of their former condition. They "were dead in the trespasses and sins" in which they once walked (Ephesians 2:1 (ESV)). They were "following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air" (Ephesians 2:2 (ESV)). This "prince" refers to Satan. All humanity once lived "in the passions of our flesh" and were "by nature children of wrath" (Ephesians 2:3 (ESV)).

**Made Alive in Christ (Ephesians 2:4-10)**: The turn comes with "But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us... made us alive together with Christ" (Ephesians 2:4-5 (ESV)). Paul interjects: "by grace you have been saved" (Ephesians 2:5 (ESV)).

God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6 (ESV)). This is a realized eschatology (the belief that some end-time blessings are already present). God did this "so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace" (Ephesians 2:7 (ESV)).

Ephesians 2:8-9 contains a frequently quoted passage: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." (ESV). This statement excludes human merit as the basis for salvation. Verse 10 clarifies: "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works" (ESV). Grace produces works; works do not produce grace.

**Breaking Down the Dividing Wall (Ephesians 2:11-22)**: Paul addresses Jew-Gentile relations. He reminds Gentile believers that they were once "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" (Ephesians 2:12 (ESV)).

"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ" (Ephesians 2:13 (ESV)). Christ "himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility" (Ephesians 2:14 (ESV)). He "abolished the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two" (Ephesians 2:15 (ESV)). The ceremonial law has been fulfilled in Christ. This creates one unified humanity.

Christ "preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near" (Ephesians 2:17 (ESV)). Resultantly, believers are "fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19 (ESV)).

**The church** is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone" (Ephesians 2:20 (ESV)). Believers are "being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit" (Ephesians 2:22 (ESV)). The church replaces the Jerusalem temple as God's dwelling place.

### Chapter 3: The Mystery Revealed and Paul's Prayer for Strength (Ephesians 3:1-21)

**The Mystery of Christ (Ephesians 3:1-13)**: Paul identifies himself as "a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles" (Ephesians 3:1 (ESV)). He reminds them "how the mystery was made known to me by revelation" (Ephesians 3:3 (ESV)). This mystery is that "the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Ephesians 3:6 (ESV)).

Paul received grace "to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ" (Ephesians 3:8 (ESV)). This was "so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10 (ESV)).

**Paul's Second Prayer (Ephesians 3:14-21)**: Paul bows his knees "before the Father" (Ephesians 3:14 (ESV)). He prays for believers to be "strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being" (Ephesians 3:16 (ESV)).

He prays that they "may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge" (Ephesians 3:18-19 (ESV)). Believers are to "know" the love that "surpasses knowledge."

The prayer concludes with a doxology: "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think... to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 3:20-21 (ESV)).

### Chapter 4: Unity and the New Life (Ephesians 4:1-32)

**Walking in Unity (Ephesians 4:1-16)**: The ethical section begins with an urge "to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called" (Ephesians 4:1 (ESV)). This involves humility, gentleness, and patience.

Paul emphasizes unity: "There is one body and one Spirit... one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:4-6 (ESV)).

"But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift" (Ephesians 4:7 (ESV)). Quoting Psalm 68:18, Paul writes: "When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men" (Ephesians 4:8 (ESV)). Christ gave "the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers" to equip the saints (Ephesians 4:11-12 (ESV)).

The goal is to attain "to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood" (Ephesians 4:13 (ESV)). Believers should no longer be "tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14 (ESV)). Instead, "speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ" (Ephesians 4:15 (ESV)).

**Putting Off the Old Self (Ephesians 4:17-32)**: Paul commands: "You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do" (Ephesians 4:17 (ESV)). Believers learned "to put off your old self... and to put on the new self" (Ephesians 4:22-24 (ESV)).

Practical applications follow: "speak the truth with his neighbor" (Ephesians 4:25 (ESV)). "Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger" (Ephesians 4:26-27 (ESV)). "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor" (Ephesians 4:28 (ESV)).

"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths" (Ephesians 4:29 (ESV)). "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God" (Ephesians 4:30 (ESV)). "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you" (Ephesians 4:32 (ESV)).

### Chapter 5: Walking in Love, Light, and Wisdom (Ephesians 5:1-33)

**Imitating God (Ephesians 5:1-20)**: "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us" (Ephesians 5:1-2 (ESV)).

"Sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you" (Ephesians 5:3 (ESV)). "Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking" (Ephesians 5:4 (ESV)). "At one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8 (ESV)).

A mysterious quotation follows: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Ephesians 5:14 (ESV)).

**Look carefully** then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise (Ephesians 5:15 (ESV)). "Do not get drunk with wine... but be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18 (ESV)).

**Marriage and the Church (Ephesians 5:21-33)**: Paul introduces "submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21 (ESV)).

"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22 (ESV)). "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her" (Ephesians 5:25 (ESV)). This sacrificial love aims "to present the church to himself in splendor" (Ephesians 5:27 (ESV)). Quoting Genesis 2:24, Paul writes: "the two shall become one flesh" (Ephesians 5:31 (ESV)). He then reveals: "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32 (ESV)).

### Chapter 6: Households, Work, and Spiritual Warfare (Ephesians 6:1-24)

**Children and Parents (Ephesians 6:1-4)**: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord" (Ephesians 6:1 (ESV)). Paul quotes the Fifth Commandment: "Honor your father and mother" (Ephesians 6:2 (ESV)).

"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4 (ESV)).

**Slaves and Masters (Ephesians 6:5-9)**: "Bondservants, obey your earthly masters... as you would Christ" (Ephesians 6:5 (ESV)). "Masters, do the same to them... knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven" (Ephesians 6:9 (ESV)).

**The Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20)**: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God" (Ephesians 6:10-11 (ESV)).

"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness" (Ephesians 6:12 (ESV)). The armor includes the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and feet shod with the gospel of peace. It also includes the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. Paul adds: "praying at all times in the Spirit" (Ephesians 6:18 (ESV)).

**Conclusion (Ephesians 6:21-24)**: Tychicus will inform them of Paul's circumstances. The letter closes with peace, love, and grace (Ephesians 6:23-24).

### Theological Significance

This survey reveals Ephesians' major theological contributions. These include predestination, salvation by grace through faith, and the cosmic significance of the church. It also highlights Christ's supremacy, the mystery of Gentile inclusion, and practical Christian ethics. The letter moves from theological reflection to the details of daily living.

## Unique Teachings

Ephesians contains several theological concepts that are unique to this letter. These distinctive teachings contribute significantly to Christian theology.

### "In the Heavenly Places"

The phrase "in the heavenly places" appears five times in Ephesians but nowhere else in the New Testament. This terminology reveals a unique spatial theology:

- Believers are blessed "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 1:3 (ESV)).
- Christ is seated "at his right hand in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 1:20 (ESV)).
- God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6 (ESV)).
- Through the church, God's wisdom is made known "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10 (ESV)).
- Spiritual warfare occurs "against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12 (ESV)).

This concept presents "the heavenly places" as a present spiritual reality. It is where believers already participate through union with Christ.

### Realized Eschatology: Already Seated with Christ

Ephesians 2:6 contains a unique statement. God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (ESV). This represents a highly developed form of realized eschatology. In Paul's other letters, resurrection and exaltation remain primarily future realities. Ephesians declares that believers already participate in Christ's resurrection and enthronement. This teaching profoundly affects Christian identity. Believers are exalted saints already participating in Christ's heavenly reign.

### The Church Displaying God's Wisdom to Cosmic Powers

Ephesians 3:10 presents a unique purpose for the church. It is to make God's wisdom known "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (ESV). This pedagogical function of the church appears nowhere else in Scripture. The church displays to cosmic powers the wisdom of God's redemptive plan. It becomes a demonstration of divine wisdom visible to principalities and powers. This explains why church unity matters so profoundly.

### Apostles and Prophets as the Foundation

Ephesians 2:20 states that the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone" (ESV). This formulation appears to differ from 1 Corinthians 3:11. There, Paul writes that Jesus Christ is the only foundation. In Ephesians, Christ is the cornerstone while apostles and prophets form the foundation. This may reflect a stage of church development where apostolic teaching had become foundational. It emphasizes the authority of apostolic tradition.

### Marriage as a Mystery Referring to Christ and the Church

Ephesians 5:25-32 develops an extended typology of marriage. It reflects Christ's relationship with the church. After quoting Genesis 2:24, Paul reveals that "this mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32 (ESV)). Human marriage prophetically points forward to Christ and the church. This teaching provides a developed New Testament theology of marriage. It establishes the husband's role as one of sacrificial love.

### The Comprehensive Armor of God

Only Ephesians 6:10-17 presents a complete and systematic description of spiritual armor. The armor includes the belt of truth and breastplate of righteousness. It also includes shoes of the gospel, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. This system is unique to Ephesians. It transformed the Christian understanding of spiritual life as warfare. It provides a paradigm for engaging the spiritual realm through moral and theological grounding.

### Comprehensive Emphasis on Spiritual Warfare

Ephesians emphasizes spiritual warfare more comprehensively than any other New Testament book. The theme appears throughout the letter. It mentions "the prince of the power of the air" (Ephesians 2:2 (ESV)). It also warns against giving opportunity to the devil (Ephesians 4:27). Every chapter touches on spiritual powers. This makes the emphasis distinctive to Ephesians.

### The Multi-Layered "Mystery"

Ephesians uses "mystery" with unique frequency. The word appears six times in the letter. It refers to "the mystery of his will" (Ephesians 1:9 (ESV)) and "the mystery of Christ" (Ephesians 3:4 (ESV)). It also refers to the mystery that includes Gentiles as fellow heirs (Ephesians 3:6). This precise definition is unique to Ephesians.

### Ephesians' View of the Church's Cosmic Role

Ephesians presents a highly developed ecclesiology. The church is described as the "fullness of him who fills all in all" (Ephesians 1:23 (ESV)). It presents the church as a universal and cosmic entity. It also combines three major church metaphors: the body, the temple, and the bride.

### "Before the Foundation of the World"

Only Ephesians uses the specific phrase "before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4 (ESV)). This temporal marker emphasizes the eternality of God's saving plan. It grounds the assurance of salvation in a plan that existed before creation.

### Why These Unique Teachings Matter

These distinctive teachings have shaped Christian theology. The "heavenly places" concept influences spiritual warfare movements. Realized eschatology affects Christian identity. Marriage as a mystery shapes theology on marriage. The armor of God provides a framework for spiritual warfare teaching. These contributions make Ephesians indispensable for comprehensive Christian theology.

## Textual Variants

Ephesians exists in numerous manuscript copies that occasionally differ. Most variants are minor, but several affect interpretation.

### Ephesians 1:1: "In Ephesus"

The phrase "in Ephesus" is absent from several early and reliable manuscripts. This includes P46, Codex Sinaiticus, and Codex Vaticanus. Origen and Basil of Caesarea also knew manuscripts without the phrase. Most later manuscripts include "in Ephesus." The majority of textual critics conclude that "in Ephesus" was likely added by scribes later. This variant supports the theory that Ephesians was a circular letter.

### Ephesians 5:30: "Of His Flesh and of His Bones"

Some manuscripts contain the longer reading "of his flesh and of his bones" (ESV). Earlier manuscripts support the shorter reading: "For we are members of his body" (Ephesians 5:30 (ESV)). The longer reading likely represents a scribal addition influenced by Genesis 2:23. It doesn't significantly change the meaning but emphasizes the connection.

### Other Notable Variants

Ephesians 1:15 mentions "your love," though some manuscripts omit it. In Ephesians 5:9, some manuscripts read "fruit of the light" while others read "fruit of the Spirit." These variations do not significantly affect the overall meaning of the letter.

### Quality of the Ephesians Text

Despite these variants, the text of Ephesians is remarkably well preserved. Approximately 98 to 99 percent of the text is certain. No major doctrine is affected by textual variants. The manuscript tradition provides overwhelming evidence for reconstructing the original text.

## Textual Errors

Scholars have identified passages that appear to contain problematic quotations or discrepancies.

### Ephesians 4:8: Misquotation of Psalm 68:18?

Psalm 68:18 says God "received gifts," while Ephesians 4:8 says He "gave gifts." This reversal of meaning has troubled scholars. One explanation is that the author followed the Aramaic Targum tradition. In that tradition, God receives tribute to distribute it as gifts. Paul applies this to Christ's ascension and His giving of gifts to the church.

### Ephesians 5:14: Quotation from an Unknown Source

Ephesians 5:14 quotes: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." (ESV). No exact Old Testament passage matches this. It likely quotes an early Christian hymn or liturgical formula. The poetic structure and baptismal imagery suggest liturgical use.

### Ephesians 6:2-3: "The First Commandment with a Promise"

Ephesians calls the fifth commandment the "first commandment with a promise" (ESV). Critics note it is not literally the first in the Decalogue. The second commandment also contains a promise. "First" likely means "foremost" or "primary." It is the most prominent commandment concerning human relationships that includes a promise.

### Ancient Quotation Practices

Ancient standards for quotation differed from modern expectations. Authors regularly quoted from memory and adapted passages to fit their arguments. These practices were standard in ancient literature. The New Testament writers were primarily concerned with theological meaning rather than archival accuracy.

## Contradictions

Scholars have identified apparent contradictions between Ephesians and other biblical books.

### Ephesians 2:8-9 vs. James 2:24: Faith or Works?

Ephesians says salvation is "not a result of works" (ESV). James says a person is "justified by works and not by faith alone" (ESV). These statements appear contradictory. However, they address different meanings of "works." Ephesians refers to human attempts to earn salvation. James refers to the evidence of genuine faith. They together present a complete picture of salvation by grace that produces good works.

### Ephesians 2:20 vs. 1 Corinthians 3:11: The Foundation

Ephesians makes apostles and prophets the foundation. First Corinthians says Christ is the only foundation. These use different architectural metaphors. In 1 Corinthians, Christ is the essential basis. In Ephesians, the focus is on the apostolic testimony to Christ. Christ remains the cornerstone that determines the alignment.

### Ephesians 2:5-6 vs. Romans 6:5: Resurrection Now or Future?

Ephesians presents believers as already raised with Christ. Romans speaks of a future resurrection. This reflects the "already/not yet" tension of New Testament theology. Believers already participate in Christ's life but await full manifestation later.

### Ephesians 5:22-24 vs. Galatians 3:28: Submission or Equality?

Ephesians commands wives to submit to husbands. Galatians declares that there is no male and female in Christ. Galatians addresses positional equality before God. Ephesians addresses functional roles within the family. Ephesians also frames this within "submitting to one another" (Ephesians 5:21 (ESV)). Husbands are commanded to love sacrificially as Christ loved the church. This was a radical subversion of existing social structures.

### Universal Church vs. Local Churches

Ephesians emphasizes a universal and cosmic church. Paul's other letters focus on local congregations. These concepts are not contradictory but reflect different theological focuses. Ephesians contemplates the universal body of Christ. This shift reflects a natural expansion of Pauline thought.

## Conclusion

The Epistle to the Ephesians provides a foundational vision for the Christian life. It moves from the [eternal purposes of God](#theological-purpose-revealing-gods-eternal-plan) to the [practical details of daily conduct](#practical-purpose-walking-worthy). The letter emphasizes the [unity of all believers](#primary-theme-unity-in-christ) and the [cosmic significance of the church](#ecclesiological-purpose-elevating-the-church). It equips believers for [spiritual warfare](#spiritual-warfare-purpose) and deepens their understanding of their [identity in Christ](#pastoral-purpose-strengthening-faith). Ephesians continues to challenge and inspire readers with its sweeping vision of God's redemptive plan for the universe.
