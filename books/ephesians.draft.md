# Ephesians

## Authorship

The authorship of Ephesians is a highly debated topic in New Testament scholarship. The epistle explicitly claims Pauline authorship (Ephesians 1:1, 3:1) and internal evidence suggests a prison setting, leading to the traditional view of Paul writing it around AD 60-62 during his Roman imprisonment. Early church fathers like Polycarp, Ignatius, and Irenaeus universally attributed it to Paul, and it appears in the [Muratorian Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muratorian_fragment) (c. AD 170).

However, modern critical scholarship is divided, with many scholars viewing Ephesians as [deutero-Pauline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Pauline_epistles)—written by a later follower of Paul. Arguments against Pauline authorship include significant stylistic differences (long, complex sentences), a unique vocabulary (38 hapax legomena in the NT), literary dependence on Colossians, lack of specificity in addressing local issues, and a more developed ecclesiology and eschatology.

Arguments for Pauline authorship highlight early universal acceptance, the letter's explicit claims, consistency with Paul's historical context, and theological alignment (despite development). Surveys show a significant split among scholars, with no clear consensus. If deutero-Pauline, it's dated AD 70-90.

## Historical Environment

### Date of Composition

The date of Ephesians depends largely on the authorship question. If Paul wrote the letter, it dates to approximately AD 60-62 during his first Roman imprisonment described in Acts 28:16-31. If the letter is deutero-Pauline, most scholars date it to AD 70-90, possibly written by a disciple of Paul in Asia Minor who sought to apply Pauline theology to new circumstances facing the church.

### Geographic and Cultural Setting: Ephesus

[Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus) was one of the most significant cities in the ancient world. As the capital of the Roman province of [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_(Roman_province)), it served as the administrative center for the region. The city was a major commercial port located at the mouth of the Cayster River near the Aegean Sea, making it a crucial gateway for trade between the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empire.

During the first century, Ephesus ranked among the most populous cities in the empire, with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 250,000 inhabitants. The city's wealth and importance were symbolized by the magnificent [Temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) (Diana in Latin), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This massive structure, rebuilt after a fire in 356 BC, measured approximately 425 feet long and 220 feet wide, with 127 columns standing 60 feet high.

### Religious Context

Ephesus was a center of diverse religious practices:

1. **Artemis Worship**: The cult of Artemis dominated Ephesian religious life. Unlike the Greek Artemis (goddess of the hunt), the Ephesian Artemis was an Asian fertility goddess. Her temple functioned not only as a religious center but also as a treasury and asylum. The silversmiths who crafted shrines of Artemis formed a powerful economic guild, as evidenced by the riot described in Acts 19:23-41.

2. **Magical Practices**: Ephesus was renowned throughout the ancient world as a center of magic and occult practices. "Ephesian letters" (Ephesia grammata) were famous magical formulae and incantations. Acts 19:18-19 describes converts burning their books of magic arts, valued at 50,000 pieces of silver—a fortune representing perhaps 50,000 days' wages. This background helps explain why Ephesians emphasizes spiritual warfare and cosmic powers more than any other Pauline letter.

3. **Imperial Cult**: As a provincial capital, Ephesus hosted temples dedicated to the Roman emperors. The imperial cult required citizens to offer sacrifices to the emperor's genius (spirit), creating potential conflicts for Christians who acknowledged only Christ as Lord.

4. **Jewish Community**: A significant Jewish population existed in Ephesus, with at least one synagogue. The Jewish-Gentile tensions reflected in Ephesians 2:11-22 mirror the demographic reality of the Ephesian church.

### Paul's Ministry in Ephesus

According to Acts 19:1-20:1, Paul spent approximately three years in Ephesus (c. AD 52-55), longer than in any other city during his missionary journeys. He initially taught in the synagogue for three months (Acts 19:8) before moving to the lecture hall of Tyrannus, where he taught daily for two years (Acts 19:9-10). During this period, "all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks" (Acts 19:10).

Paul's coworkers and disciples spread the gospel to surrounding cities including [Colossae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossae), [Laodicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laodicea_on_the_Lycus), and [Hierapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierapolis). Epaphras apparently established the church at Colossae (Colossians 1:7), which Paul himself may never have visited (Colossians 2:1). This network of house churches throughout the Lycus Valley and broader Asia Minor region forms the likely original audience for Ephesians.

### The Circular Letter Theory

A significant textual issue affects our understanding of the letter's destination. The phrase "in Ephesus" (en Ephesō) in Ephesians 1:1 is absent from the earliest and most reliable manuscripts, including P46 (c. AD 200), Codex Sinaiticus, and Codex Vaticanus. Early church fathers Origen and Basil noted this absence. This has led most scholars to conclude that Ephesians was originally a circular letter intended for multiple congregations in Asia Minor rather than exclusively for Ephesus.

Several factors support the circular letter theory:

1. **Lack of Personal Greetings**: Unlike Paul's other letters, Ephesians contains no personal greetings to individuals, despite Paul's three-year ministry in Ephesus where he would have known many believers personally.

2. **Generic Content**: The letter addresses no specific local problems or controversies, unlike every other Pauline epistle. Its content is broadly applicable to any congregation.

3. **Ephesians 1:15**: Paul writes, "I have heard of your faith," suggesting he didn't know the recipients personally—strange if written to Ephesus where he ministered for three years.

4. **Ancient Practice**: Other circular letters existed in early Christianity (Revelation 1-3 addresses seven churches; 2 Peter 3:1 mentions a previous letter).

The letter was likely read aloud in various house churches throughout the region, with each congregation inserting their own city name when reading "to the saints who are [in ___] and faithful in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 1:1). Eventually, the most prominent city, Ephesus, lent its name to the epistle.

### Political Environment

The letter was written (or is set) during the [Pax Romana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana), the period of relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 180). This peace facilitated travel, communication, and the spread of the gospel. However, it also brought challenges:

1. **Roman Authority**: The empire's power structure, with the emperor at its apex, influenced social hierarchies that the household codes (Ephesians 5:21-6:9) both reflect and subtly subvert.

2. **Slavery**: The Roman economy depended heavily on slavery. Perhaps one-third of the empire's population were enslaved, with higher percentages in urban areas like Ephesus. Ephesians' instructions to slaves and masters (Ephesians 6:5-9) address a ubiquitous social reality.

3. **Household Structures**: The Greco-Roman household (oikos) was the basic social unit, governed by the paterfamilias (male head of household) who held legal authority over wife, children, and slaves. The household codes in Ephesians 5:21-6:9 engage with these structures.

### Social Context

The Ephesian church comprised believers from diverse backgrounds:

1. **Jewish and Gentile Believers**: The sharp division between Jews and Gentiles—with distinct cultural practices, religious traditions, and social standing—forms a central concern in Ephesians 2:11-22. Paul describes Christ as breaking down "the dividing wall of hostility" between these groups (Ephesians 2:14).

2. **Economic Diversity**: The church likely included wealthy merchants, skilled artisans, day laborers, and slaves. This economic stratification created potential tensions that Christian unity was meant to overcome.

3. **Educational Variation**: Literacy rates in the Roman Empire hovered around 10-15%, with higher rates in cities. Most believers would have heard Ephesians read aloud in house church gatherings rather than reading it themselves.

### Audience

Whether the original recipients were exclusively Ephesian Christians or multiple congregations throughout Asia Minor, they were primarily Gentile converts (Ephesians 2:11, 3:1). Paul addresses them as those who were formerly "separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world" (Ephesians 2:12). Many had backgrounds in paganism, magic, and immorality (Ephesians 4:17-19, 5:3-12), requiring clear teaching on Christian ethics and identity.

The letter assumes an audience familiar with Jewish Scripture, as evidenced by references to Old Testament passages (Ephesians 4:8 quotes Psalm 68:18; Ephesians 5:31 quotes Genesis 2:24; Ephesians 6:2-3 quotes Exodus 20:12). This suggests either substantial Jewish-Christian presence in these congregations or Gentile converts who had been catechized in the Scriptures.

### Historical Circumstances

If written by Paul around AD 60-62, the letter comes from a period when Christianity was beginning to face more systematic opposition from both Jewish and Roman authorities. Paul himself was imprisoned, awaiting trial before Caesar Nero (reigned AD 54-68). Within a few years, Nero would initiate the first imperial persecution of Christians following the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64.

If written after Paul's death (AD 70-90), the letter emerges from a church facing new challenges: the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (AD 70), increasing separation from Judaism, growing persecution, internal divisions, and the need to preserve and apply apostolic teaching for second-generation believers who never knew the apostles personally.

## Purpose

Ephesians serves multiple interconnected purposes, blending profound theology with practical application. Unlike most of Paul's letters, which address specific local controversies, Ephesians presents a comprehensive vision of God's eternal plan and the church's role within it.

### Primary Theme: Unity in Christ

The central purpose of Ephesians is to proclaim and promote the unity of Jews and Gentiles in the one body of Christ. This theme pervades the entire letter:

**The Broken Barrier** (Ephesians 2:11-22): The author addresses Gentile believers, reminding them that they were once "separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" (Ephesians 2:12). Christ's death accomplished cosmic reconciliation, breaking down "the dividing wall of hostility" between these two groups (Ephesians 2:14). This "wall" likely refers both metaphorically to the Torah's ceremonial laws that separated Jews and Gentiles and possibly to the physical barrier in the Jerusalem Temple that prohibited Gentiles from entering the inner courts under penalty of death.

**One New Humanity** (Ephesians 2:15): Christ created "one new man in place of the two," a radically new identity that transcends ethnic, cultural, and religious divisions. This was revolutionary in the ancient world, where ethnic identity was fundamental to personal and social identity.

**The Mystery Revealed** (Ephesians 3:2-6): Paul describes his special revelation regarding "the mystery of Christ," which he defines explicitly: "the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Ephesians 3:6). This "mystery" was God's long-hidden plan, now revealed, that salvation extends equally to all peoples without ethnic distinction.

**Practical Unity** (Ephesians 4:1-16): The letter urges believers to "maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3), emphasizing "one body and one Spirit...one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:4-6). The sevenfold repetition of "one" hammers home the message of Christian unity.

### Theological Purpose: Revealing God's Eternal Plan

Ephesians unfolds God's cosmic purposes across the ages:

**Predestination and Election** (Ephesians 1:3-14): The letter reveals that God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4) and "predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 1:5). This was not an afterthought but God's predetermined plan "for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth" (Ephesians 1:10).

**The Church's Cosmic Significance**: Ephesians presents the church not merely as a human organization but as the vehicle through which God displays His wisdom "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10). The church itself becomes a teaching instrument for angelic beings, demonstrating God's redemptive wisdom.

**Christ's Supremacy**: The letter establishes Christ's absolute supremacy over all cosmic powers. God seated Christ "at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion" (Ephesians 1:20-21), with "all things under his feet" (Ephesians 1:22). This cosmic Christology addresses believers living in a world perceived as populated by spiritual powers—a world where magic, astrology, and worship of various deities competed for allegiance.

### Practical Purpose: Walking Worthy

Ephesians divides naturally into two halves: theological foundation (chapters 1-3) and ethical application (chapters 4-6). The hinge comes at Ephesians 4:1: "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."

The word "walk" (Greek: peripateō) appears repeatedly in chapters 4-6, describing various aspects of Christian conduct:

- **Walk in unity** (Ephesians 4:1-16): Living out the oneness that exists positionally
- **Walk differently from pagans** (Ephesians 4:17-24): Putting off the old self and putting on the new
- **Walk in love** (Ephesians 5:1-7): Imitating God as beloved children
- **Walk as children of light** (Ephesians 5:8-14): Living in moral clarity
- **Walk carefully** (Ephesians 5:15-21): Living wisely, understanding God's will
- **Walk in ordered relationships** (Ephesians 5:21-6:9): Applying Christian principles to household relationships

The letter addresses specific behavioral concerns that would have been particularly relevant for Gentile converts coming from pagan backgrounds:

- **Moral purity** (Ephesians 4:17-5:14): Rejecting sexual immorality, impurity, covetousness, filthy talk, and crude joking
- **Truthfulness** (Ephesians 4:25): Putting away falsehood and speaking truth
- **Controlled anger** (Ephesians 4:26-27): Managing anger without giving opportunity to the devil
- **Honest labor** (Ephesians 4:28): Working honestly rather than stealing
- **Edifying speech** (Ephesians 4:29): Using words to build up rather than tear down

### Ecclesiological Purpose: Elevating the Church

Ephesians presents the highest view of the church found anywhere in Scripture:

**The Church as Christ's Body** (Ephesians 1:22-23): Christ is "head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all." The church is not merely Christ's organization but His very fullness—the means by which He fills everything.

**The Church as God's Building** (Ephesians 2:19-22): Believers are "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone," being "built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit." The church is God's temple, His dwelling place on earth.

**The Church as Christ's Bride** (Ephesians 5:25-32): Christ "loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her...that he might present the church to himself in splendor." The marriage relationship becomes a profound picture of Christ's relationship with His church.

This exalted ecclesiology serves to remind believers of their corporate identity and significance. In a world where Christians formed a tiny, sometimes persecuted minority, Ephesians assures them that they belong to an entity of cosmic importance.

### Spiritual Warfare Purpose

Uniquely among Paul's letters, Ephesians emphasizes spiritual warfare as an ongoing reality for believers. The letter's closing section (Ephesians 6:10-20) describes the Christian life as warfare "against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12).

This emphasis would have resonated particularly with Ephesian believers, given the city's reputation as a center of magical practices. The letter provides an alternative paradigm: rather than manipulating spiritual powers through magic, believers resist evil spiritual forces through:

- Truth
- Righteousness
- The gospel of peace
- Faith
- Salvation
- God's word
- Prayer

### Pastoral Purpose: Strengthening Faith

The letter aims to strengthen believers' faith and deepen their understanding of their identity in Christ. Paul's (or the author's) prayers in Ephesians 1:15-23 and 3:14-21 reveal these pastoral concerns:

**That believers might know**:
- "What is the hope to which he has called you"
- "What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints"
- "What is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe" (Ephesians 1:18-19)

**That believers might be**:
- "Strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being"
- Able "to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth"
- Able "to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge"
- "Filled with all the fullness of God" (Ephesians 3:16-19)

These prayers reflect the letter's purpose: not merely to inform but to transform, moving believers from intellectual knowledge to experiential understanding of God's love and power.

### Summary of Purposes

Ephesians was written to:

1. **Proclaim** the unity of Jews and Gentiles in Christ's body, breaking down ancient ethnic barriers
2. **Reveal** God's eternal plan to unite all things in Christ through the church
3. **Establish** Christ's supremacy over all cosmic powers
4. **Teach** believers how to live worthy of their calling in Christ
5. **Elevate** believers' understanding of the church's significance
6. **Equip** believers for spiritual warfare against evil powers
7. **Strengthen** believers' faith and deepen their experiential knowledge of God's love
8. **Transform** behavior, particularly addressing issues relevant to Gentile converts from paganism
9. **Preserve** and apply apostolic teaching for the church (if written after Paul's death)

The letter addresses the whole person—mind, will, and heart—providing both doctrinal foundation and practical application for Christian life. Its purpose is simultaneously theological, ethical, pastoral, and spiritual, making it one of the most comprehensive statements of Christian belief and practice in the New Testament.

## Cross-References

Ephesians both draws upon earlier Scripture and influences later New Testament writings, creating a rich web of intertextual connections that illuminate its theological significance.

### Old Testament Quotations in Ephesians

Ephesians explicitly quotes the Old Testament several times, though notably less frequently than some other Pauline letters like Romans or Galatians:

**Psalm 68:18 in Ephesians 4:8**

The most discussed Old Testament quotation appears in Ephesians 4:8: "Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.'" This quotes (or alludes to) Psalm 68:18, which in the Hebrew reads: "You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men." The significant difference—"receiving" versus "giving"—has generated scholarly discussion. The author may be following the Aramaic Targum tradition, which interprets the psalm as God receiving tribute in order to distribute it as gifts. Paul applies this victory imagery to Christ's ascension and His giving of spiritual gifts to the church. (See Textual Errors section for fuller discussion.)

**Genesis 2:24 in Ephesians 5:31**

Ephesians 5:31 quotes Genesis 2:24 in its discussion of marriage: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." This foundational text about marriage is then interpreted mystically: "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32), elevating the marriage union to a picture of Christ's relationship with His bride.

**Exodus 20:12 in Ephesians 6:2-3**

The fifth commandment is quoted in Ephesians 6:2-3: "Honor your father and mother (this is the first commandment with a promise), that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." Notably, Ephesians quotes from Deuteronomy 5:16's version of the commandment, which includes the phrase "that it may go well with you," absent from Exodus 20:12.

**Isaiah 60:1 in Ephesians 5:14**

Ephesians 5:14 introduces a quotation with "Therefore it says": "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." No exact Old Testament passage matches this quotation. Isaiah 60:1 comes closest ("Arise, shine, for your light has come"), but the differences are substantial. Most scholars conclude this quotes either: (1) an early Christian hymn or liturgical text, possibly used in baptismal contexts; (2) a conflation of multiple Old Testament passages (Isaiah 26:19, 51:17, 52:1, 60:1); or (3) a lost apocryphal source. (See Textual Errors section for fuller discussion.)

### Old Testament Allusions in Ephesians

Beyond direct quotations, Ephesians contains numerous allusions to Old Testament texts:

**Psalm 110:1** is referenced in Ephesians 1:20 and 2:6, which describe Christ seated at God's right hand—Psalm 110:1's key image: "The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand.'" This psalm is the most quoted or alluded to Old Testament text in the New Testament, appearing throughout early Christian writings to demonstrate Christ's exaltation and messianic identity.

**Creation Language**: Ephesians 2:10 ("For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works") echoes Genesis creation language, presenting believers as God's new creation.

**Temple Imagery**: Ephesians 2:19-22, describing the church as God's temple with Christ as cornerstone, alludes to Isaiah 28:16 ("Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone") and other temple-building passages.

**Armor of God**: Ephesians 6:14-17 draws heavily on Isaiah 59:17 ("He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing"), transforming divine warrior imagery into Christian spiritual warfare equipment.

### Extensive Parallels with Colossians

The most striking feature of Ephesians' cross-references is its extraordinary literary relationship with Colossians. Of Ephesians' 155 verses, approximately 73-75 show verbal parallels with Colossians. This represents nearly half the epistle and has led most scholars to conclude either:

1. Paul wrote both letters simultaneously, covering similar themes for related audiences
2. The author of Ephesians used Colossians as a source, expanding its themes
3. Both letters depend on a common earlier source

**Specific Verbal Parallels:**

Some passages show remarkably close wording:

- **Ephesians 6:21-22 and Colossians 4:7-8**: These verses are virtually identical in Greek, describing Tychicus as the letter bearer
- **Colossians 1:1-2 and Ephesians 1:1-2**: Both openings contain 7 consecutive identical words
- **Colossians 1:26 and Ephesians 3:9**: Seven consecutive identical words discussing "the mystery"
- **Colossians 1:14 and Ephesians 1:7**: Five consecutive identical words about redemption
- **Colossians 2:5 and Ephesians 4:16**: Five consecutive identical words

**Thematic Parallels:**

Beyond verbal similarities, the letters share structural and thematic parallels:

| **Theme** | **Colossians** | **Ephesians** |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Christ as head of the body | 1:18, 24 | 1:22-23; 4:15; 5:23 |
| The mystery revealed | 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3 | 1:9; 3:3-6, 9; 5:32; 6:19 |
| Putting off/putting on | 3:8-14 | 4:22-32 |
| Wives submit to husbands | 3:18 | 5:22-24 |
| Husbands love wives | 3:19 | 5:25-33 |
| Children obey parents | 3:20 | 6:1-3 |
| Fathers and children | 3:21 | 6:4 |
| Slaves and masters | 3:22-4:1 | 6:5-9 |
| Prayer requests | 4:2-4 | 6:18-20 |
| Tychicus as messenger | 4:7-8 | 6:21-22 |

**Key Differences in Treatment:**

While covering similar ground, Ephesians often expands themes treated more briefly in Colossians:

- **Colossians 1:21-22 (2 verses)** on reconciliation becomes **Ephesians 2:11-22 (12 verses)**, extensively developing the Jew-Gentile unity theme
- **Colossians' household code (3:18-4:1, 15 verses)** becomes **Ephesians' expanded treatment (5:21-6:9, 33 verses)**, particularly elaborating the husband-wife relationship with Christ-church imagery
- **The "mystery"** in Colossians is primarily Christ himself (Colossians 1:27), while in Ephesians it's specifically the inclusion of Gentiles as fellow heirs (Ephesians 3:6)

### References to Ephesians in Other New Testament Books

Unlike Old Testament books that are frequently quoted in the New Testament, Ephesians itself is rarely if ever explicitly quoted by later New Testament writers. However, some scholars detect possible allusions:

**1 Peter**

First Peter shares numerous themes and some verbal parallels with Ephesians:
- Both contain household codes with similar structure and content (Ephesians 5:21-6:9; 1 Peter 2:18-3:7)
- Both describe believers as a spiritual house/temple (Ephesians 2:19-22; 1 Peter 2:4-5)
- Both emphasize putting off the old self and being renewed (Ephesians 4:22-24; 1 Peter 1:14-16)
- Both speak of Christ's preaching to spirits (Ephesians 4:8-10; 1 Peter 3:19)

Many scholars conclude that 1 Peter knew and utilized Ephesians, though the direction of influence is debated. Peter "does not compartmentalize his thought as well as does Paul," and Romans and Ephesians are "the two books on which Peter most heavily relies."

**2 Peter**

Second Peter 3:15-16 states: "Count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters." This likely refers to letters circulating in Asia Minor, which would include Colossians and possibly Ephesians. Some scholars believe 2 Peter demonstrates awareness of Ephesians.

**The Pastoral Epistles**

First and Second Timothy and Titus share theological emphases with Ephesians, including:
- Church order and the role of apostles and prophets
- The concept of "sound doctrine"
- Emphasis on God's plan "before the ages began" (2 Timothy 1:9; cf. Ephesians 1:4)
- Similar ethical instructions

These parallels may indicate either common authorship, use of common traditions, or literary dependence.

### Early Church Fathers

While not part of the New Testament canon, early church fathers extensively quoted and alluded to Ephesians, demonstrating its early acceptance and influence:

**Ignatius of Antioch** (c. AD 105-115) references Ephesians multiple times in his letter to the Ephesians, including allusions to Ephesians 5:25-27 regarding Christ's love for the church.

**Polycarp** (c. AD 110-140), in his Letter to the Philippians, quotes Ephesians 2:8-9 regarding salvation by grace through faith, explicitly identifying it as Scripture.

**Clement of Rome** (c. AD 96) shows familiarity with Ephesian themes, though direct quotations are harder to identify.

**The Muratorian Canon** (c. AD 170) lists Ephesians among Paul's authentic letters without question.

### Statistical Overview

**Ephesians' Use of the Old Testament:**
- Direct quotations: 4-5 (depending on classification)
- Significant allusions: 15-20 (estimates vary)
- Verbal echoes and phraseology: numerous

Compared to Romans (60+ OT quotations) or Galatians (10+ quotations), Ephesians quotes the Old Testament sparingly, focusing more on applying theological principles than defending them through Scripture citation.

**Ephesians' Influence on Other NT Books:**
Unlike Old Testament books heavily quoted in the New Testament, Ephesians is rarely if ever explicitly quoted by other New Testament writers. Its primary influence appears through:
- Theological concepts adopted by later writers
- Liturgical and hymnic material possibly shared with other traditions
- Household codes paralleled in 1 Peter and the Pastoral Epistles

### Scholarly Resources on Intertextuality

For those interested in deeper study of Ephesians' intertextual relationships:

- [New Testament Use of the Old Testament - Roger Nicole](https://www.bible-researcher.com/nicole.html)

The rich tapestry of cross-references in Ephesians demonstrates both its rootedness in Jewish Scripture and its role in developing Christian theology, particularly ecclesiology and ethics, for the early church.

## Canonical Status

Ephesians enjoys one of the strongest canonical statuses of any New Testament book. Unlike several other epistles that faced questions or disputes in the early church, Ephesians was universally accepted as authoritative Scripture from the earliest period for which we have evidence.

### Early and Universal Acceptance

From the beginning of the second century onward, Ephesians appears in every major list of canonical New Testament books and is never mentioned among disputed writings. This stands in contrast to books like Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation, which faced varying degrees of questioning or regional acceptance disputes in the early centuries.

### Testimony of Early Church Fathers

The earliest Christian writers after the apostolic age demonstrate clear knowledge and use of Ephesians:

**Clement of Rome** (c. AD 96), in his *First Epistle to the Corinthians*, shows familiarity with Ephesian theology and possibly quotes or alludes to the letter, though direct verbal parallels are difficult to establish with certainty. This represents potential evidence within a decade or two of Ephesians' composition.

**Ignatius of Antioch** (c. AD 105-115) explicitly addresses a letter "To the Ephesians" and makes clear allusions to Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. In particular, Ignatius references concepts and language from Ephesians 5:25-27 about Christ's love for the church. His writings demonstrate that Ephesians was known, valued, and considered authoritative in Syria within a generation of its writing.

**Polycarp of Smyrna** (c. AD 110-140), a disciple of the Apostle John, quotes Ephesians 2:8-9 in his *Letter to the Philippians* (1:3): "For by grace you have been saved, not by works." Significantly, Polycarp treats this as authoritative Scripture, not merely as a historical letter. This testimony is particularly weighty given Polycarp's direct connection to the apostolic generation. His acceptance of Ephesians as Scripture represents a bridge between the apostles and the second-century church.

**Hermas** (c. AD 140-155), in *The Shepherd*, may allude to Ephesian themes, though direct quotations are unclear.

**Justin Martyr** (c. AD 150-160) shows knowledge of Ephesians in his writings, with distinct references to the epistle appearing in his works.

**Marcion's Canon** (c. AD 140): Even the heretic Marcion, who drastically reduced the canon to only Luke's Gospel and ten Pauline epistles, included "Laodiceans" in his list—which scholars generally identify as Ephesians. This indicates that even those who drastically edited the canon found Ephesians too central to exclude.

### Early Canonical Lists

**The Muratorian Fragment** (c. AD 170-200): This oldest surviving list of New Testament books, discovered by Ludovico Antonio Muratorian in 1740, explicitly includes Ephesians among Paul's authentic letters. The fragment states that Paul wrote to seven churches (following the pattern of the prophets who addressed Israel), and Ephesians appears in this list without qualification or doubt.

**Eusebius of Caesarea** (*Ecclesiastical History*, c. AD 325): Eusebius categorized New Testament books into three groups: (1) universally acknowledged books (*homologoumena*), (2) disputed books (*antilegomena*), and (3) spurious or heretical books (*notha*). Ephesians appears in the first category—the undisputed books—alongside the four Gospels, Acts, Paul's major letters, 1 John, and 1 Peter. Eusebius notes no controversy whatsoever regarding Ephesians.

**The Cheltenham Canon** (c. AD 360): Lists Ephesians among the canonical letters of Paul.

**Athanasius' Festal Letter** (AD 367): The bishop of Alexandria, in his thirty-ninth Festal Letter, provides the earliest complete list of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament that matches the current canon. Ephesians is included without comment as obviously canonical.

**The Councils of Hippo** (AD 393) and **Carthage** (AD 397): These North African councils formalized the New Testament canon, including Ephesians without debate.

### Manuscript Evidence

The manuscript tradition provides strong support for Ephesians' early acceptance:

**Papyrus 46** (P46, c. AD 200): One of the earliest substantial New Testament manuscripts, this papyrus codex contains Ephesians in full (chapters 1-6), demonstrating that the letter was considered important enough to include in an expensive early collection of Paul's epistles. P46 includes Romans, Hebrews, 1-2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians—placing Ephesians among the core Pauline writings.

**Codex Sinaiticus** (א, 4th century): Contains Ephesians as part of the Pauline corpus.

**Codex Vaticanus** (B, 4th century): Includes Ephesians without any marginal notes questioning its status.

**Codex Alexandrinus** (A, 5th century): Contains Ephesians.

The consistent presence of Ephesians in all major early manuscripts and codices indicates its undisputed canonical status.

### Reasons for Acceptance

Several factors explain Ephesians' universal and uncontested canonical status:

**1. Apostolic Authorship**: The letter explicitly claims to be from Paul, "an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God" (Ephesians 1:1). In the ancient church, apostolic authorship or connection was the primary criterion for canonicity. Whether Paul wrote Ephesians personally or whether a close associate wrote it in his name, the early church universally attributed it to Paul, meeting the apostolic criterion.

**2. Early and Widespread Use**: From the early second century, Ephesians was quoted, alluded to, and used liturgically across diverse geographical regions—Rome (Clement), Syria (Ignatius), Asia Minor (Polycarp), and North Africa. This widespread geographic distribution indicates the letter circulated broadly and was valued universally, not just in one region.

**3. Theological Orthodoxy**: Ephesians' teaching aligned perfectly with emerging orthodox Christian theology. Its high Christology, emphasis on grace, teaching on the church, and ethical instructions supported rather than contradicted the apostolic faith. No heretical groups claimed Ephesians as supporting their positions (unlike texts such as the Gospel of Thomas or various Gnostic writings).

**4. Liturgical Use**: Evidence suggests Ephesians was used in Christian worship and instruction from early times. Passages like Ephesians 5:14 ("Awake, O sleeper") may derive from or have been incorporated into baptismal liturgies. This liturgical use cemented the letter's authority.

**5. Lack of Controversial Content**: Unlike books that faced canonical questions (e.g., Hebrews' authorship was disputed; James seemed to contradict Paul on faith and works; Revelation's apocalyptic imagery caused concern), Ephesians contained nothing that raised red flags for early Christian communities.

### No Canonical Disputes Across Christian Traditions

Remarkably, Ephesians is accepted across all major Christian traditions without exception:

- **Roman Catholic Church**: Included in all official canons
- **Eastern Orthodox Church**: Accepted as fully canonical
- **Oriental Orthodox Churches**: Recognized as Scripture
- **Protestant Churches**: Included in all Protestant canons since the Reformation
- **Anglican Communion**: Recognized as canonical
- **Other Christian Bodies**: Universally accepted

This ecumenical consensus is noteworthy. While Christians disagree about the deuterocanonical books (the Apocrypha), and while the Ethiopian Orthodox Church has an expanded canon, no Christian tradition excludes or questions Ephesians.

### Modern Scholarly Acceptance

While modern critical scholars debate Pauline authorship (see Authorship section), this question is entirely separate from canonical status. Even scholars who conclude Ephesians is deutero-Pauline (written by a follower of Paul) do not question its canonical status or authoritative role in Christian Scripture. The canonical question concerns whether a book functions authoritatively for the church, not whether particular authorship theories are correct.

The [Society of Biblical Literature](https://www.sbl-site.org/) and scholarly commentaries universally treat Ephesians as canonical New Testament Scripture, regardless of scholars' views on authorship. The letter's theological richness, ethical teaching, and influence on Christian thought secure its canonical significance regardless of authorship debates.

### Why This Matters

The strong canonical status of Ephesians matters for several reasons:

**Historical Reliability**: The early, widespread, and uncontested acceptance suggests the letter was recognized as authoritative from the time of its composition or shortly thereafter. This provides confidence in its authenticity as representing apostolic-era Christianity.

**Theological Authority**: Christians across traditions can appeal to Ephesians with confidence that it represents authentic Christian teaching, carrying the weight of nearly 2,000 years of universal church recognition.

**Textual Preservation**: Books with strong canonical status received more careful copying and preservation. The excellent manuscript tradition of Ephesians reflects its valued status, giving us confidence in the reliability of its text.

## Summary

Ephesians presents a majestic vision of God's eternal plan to unite all things in Christ through the church. Unlike many biblical books containing direct divine speeches or prophecies ("Thus says the LORD"), Ephesians is an apostolic letter containing Paul's Spirit-inspired teaching about God's revelation. The entire letter constitutes authoritative Christian doctrine about God's purposes, though it does not present itself as direct quotation of God's words. Rather, it explains and applies divine truth revealed through Christ and the apostles.

### Chapter 1: Spiritual Blessings in Christ and Prayer for Wisdom (Ephesians 1:1-23)

**Greeting (Ephesians 1:1-2)**: Paul identifies himself as "an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God" and addresses "the saints who are [in Ephesus] and are faithful in Christ Jesus," offering grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**Spiritual Blessings (Ephesians 1:3-14)**: The letter opens with one of the New Testament's most magnificent theological statements. Paul blesses "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 1:3). This single Greek sentence spanning verses 3-14 unfolds God's redemptive plan across time:

God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Ephesians 1:4). This predestination occurred before creation, grounding salvation in God's eternal purpose rather than human merit. God "predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace" (Ephesians 1:5-6).

"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace" (Ephesians 1:7). Redemption—the language of slaves being purchased and freed—comes through Christ's blood, emphasizing the costliness of salvation.

God "made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth" (Ephesians 1:9-10). The "mystery" is God's previously hidden plan now revealed: cosmic unity through Christ.

Believers "have obtained an inheritance" and were "sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it" (Ephesians 1:11-14). The Holy Spirit functions as down payment and guarantee of future complete redemption.

**Paul's Prayer (Ephesians 1:15-23)**: After hearing of the recipients' "faith in the Lord Jesus" and "love toward all the saints" (Ephesians 1:15), Paul prays continually for them. He asks that God "give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened" (Ephesians 1:17-18).

Paul's prayer has three specific requests: (1) that they know "what is the hope to which he has called you," (2) "what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints," and (3) "what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe" (Ephesians 1:18-19).

This power is "the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named" (Ephesians 1:20-21). God "put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all" (Ephesians 1:22-23). This cosmic Christology establishes Christ's absolute supremacy over all spiritual powers.

### Chapter 2: From Death to Life, From Division to Unity (Ephesians 2:1-22)

**Dead in Sin (Ephesians 2:1-3)**: Paul reminds readers of their former condition: "You were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air" (Ephesians 2:1-2). This "prince of the power of the air" refers to Satan. All humanity once lived "in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath" (Ephesians 2:3).

**Made Alive in Christ (Ephesians 2:4-10)**: The dramatic turn comes with "But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ" (Ephesians 2:4-5). Here Paul interjects a parenthetical statement that becomes one of Christianity's most famous declarations: "by grace you have been saved" (Ephesians 2:5).

God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6). Believers already participate in Christ's exalted position—a realized eschatology. God did this "so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:7).

Ephesians 2:8-9 contains perhaps the letter's most frequently quoted passage: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." This unambiguous statement excludes human merit as the basis for salvation. However, verse 10 immediately clarifies: "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them." Grace produces works; works do not produce grace.

**Breaking Down the Dividing Wall (Ephesians 2:11-22)**: Paul now addresses the specific issue of Jew-Gentile relations. He reminds Gentile believers to "remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world" (Ephesians 2:12). This was the Gentiles' desperate spiritual condition before Christ.

"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility" (Ephesians 2:13-14). Christ "abolished the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two" (Ephesians 2:15). The ceremonial law that separated Jews from Gentiles has been fulfilled in Christ, creating one unified humanity.

Christ came and "preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father" (Ephesians 2:17-18). The result: "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19).

The church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord" (Ephesians 2:20-21). Believers together are "being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit" (Ephesians 2:22). The church replaces the Jerusalem temple as God's dwelling place.

### Chapter 3: The Mystery Revealed and Paul's Prayer for Strength (Ephesians 3:1-21)

**The Mystery of Christ (Ephesians 3:1-13)**: Paul identifies himself as "a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles" (Ephesians 3:1). He reminds them "how the mystery was made known to me by revelation" (Ephesians 3:3). This mystery, "which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit" (Ephesians 3:5), is explicitly defined: "the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Ephesians 3:6).

Paul received grace "to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God" (Ephesians 3:8-9). The purpose: "so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10). The church itself becomes a demonstration to angelic beings of God's wisdom.

**Paul's Second Prayer (Ephesians 3:14-21)**: Paul bows his knees "before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named" (Ephesians 3:14-15), praying for believers to be "strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith" (Ephesians 3:16-17).

He prays that they, "being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge" (Ephesians 3:17-19). Paradoxically, believers are to "know" the love that "surpasses knowledge"—moving from intellectual assent to experiential reality.

The prayer concludes with a doxology: "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen" (Ephesians 3:20-21).

### Chapter 4: Unity and the New Life (Ephesians 4:1-32)

**Walking in Unity (Ephesians 4:1-16)**: The letter's ethical section begins with "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called" (Ephesians 4:1). This involves "humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:2-3).

Paul emphasizes unity through sevenfold repetition: "There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call—one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" (Ephesians 4:4-6).

"But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift" (Ephesians 4:7). Quoting Psalm 68:18 (with modification), Paul writes: "When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men" (Ephesians 4:8). Christ "gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ" (Ephesians 4:11-12).

The goal is "until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). Believers should "no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14), but rather "speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ" (Ephesians 4:15).

**Putting Off the Old Self (Ephesians 4:17-32)**: Paul commands: "You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them" (Ephesians 4:17-18). Gentiles "have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity" (Ephesians 4:19).

Believers learned differently: "to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness" (Ephesians 4:22-24).

Practical applications follow: "Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor" (Ephesians 4:25). "Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil" (Ephesians 4:26-27). "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need" (Ephesians 4:28).

"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear" (Ephesians 4:29). "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30). "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you" (Ephesians 4:31-32).

### Chapter 5: Walking in Love, Light, and Wisdom (Ephesians 5:1-33)

**Imitating God (Ephesians 5:1-20)**: "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (Ephesians 5:1-2).

"But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints" (Ephesians 5:3). "Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving" (Ephesians 5:4). Paul warns: "For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God" (Ephesians 5:5).

"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience" (Ephesians 5:6). "For at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8). "Try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them" (Ephesians 5:10-11).

A mysterious quotation follows: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Ephesians 5:14). This may be an early Christian hymn or baptismal liturgy.

"Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil" (Ephesians 5:15-16). "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:17-18).

**Marriage and the Church (Ephesians 5:21-33)**: Paul introduces the household codes with "submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21), establishing mutual submission as the framework.

"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22), because "the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior" (Ephesians 5:23).

"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word" (Ephesians 5:25-26). This sacrificial love aims "to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish" (Ephesians 5:27).

"In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies" (Ephesians 5:28). Quoting Genesis 2:24, Paul writes: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh" (Ephesians 5:31). He then reveals: "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32).

### Chapter 6: Households, Work, and Spiritual Warfare (Ephesians 6:1-24)

**Children and Parents (Ephesians 6:1-4)**: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother' (this is the first commandment with a promise), 'that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land'" (Ephesians 6:1-3), quoting the Fifth Commandment.

"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).

**Slaves and Masters (Ephesians 6:5-9)**: "Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ" (Ephesians 6:5). They should serve "not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart" (Ephesians 6:6), "knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord" (Ephesians 6:8).

"Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him" (Ephesians 6:9).

**The Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20)**: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil" (Ephesians 6:10-11).

"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12). This verse establishes the Christian life as spiritual warfare against demonic powers.

"Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm" (Ephesians 6:13). The armor includes:
- "the belt of truth" (Ephesians 6:14)
- "the breastplate of righteousness" (Ephesians 6:14)
- feet shod "with the readiness given by the gospel of peace" (Ephesians 6:15)
- "the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one" (Ephesians 6:16)
- "the helmet of salvation" (Ephesians 6:17)
- "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17)

Paul adds: "praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication" (Ephesians 6:18).

**Conclusion (Ephesians 6:21-24)**: Tychicus will inform them of Paul's circumstances (Ephesians 6:21-22). The letter closes: "Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible" (Ephesians 6:23-24).

### Theological Significance

This comprehensive survey reveals Ephesians' major theological contributions: predestination and election, salvation by grace through faith alone, the cosmic significance of the church, Christ's supremacy over all powers, the mystery of Gentile inclusion, practical Christian ethics, and spiritual warfare. The letter moves seamlessly from the heights of theological reflection to the details of daily Christian living, demonstrating that sound doctrine produces transformed behavior.

## Unique Teachings

Ephesians contains several theological concepts, phrases, and emphases that are either entirely unique to this letter or receive their fullest development here. These distinctive teachings contribute significantly to Christian theology and set Ephesians apart from other Pauline epistles.

### "In the Heavenly Places"

The phrase "in the heavenly places" (Greek: *en tois epouraniois*) appears five times in Ephesians (1:3, 1:20, 2:6, 3:10, 6:12) but nowhere else in the Pauline corpus or indeed anywhere else in the New Testament. This distinctive terminology reveals Ephesians' unique spatial theology:

- Believers are blessed "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 1:3)
- Christ is seated "at his right hand in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 1:20)
- God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6)
- Through the church, God's wisdom is made known "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10)
- Spiritual warfare occurs "against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12)

This concept presents "the heavenly places" not as a distant future destination but as a present spiritual reality where believers already participate through union with Christ. It is simultaneously the location of divine blessing, Christ's exaltation, believers' positional reality, cosmic powers (both good and evil), and spiritual warfare. No other New Testament book develops this multi-dimensional understanding of heavenly realities.

### Realized Eschatology: Already Seated with Christ

Ephesians 2:6 contains a unique statement: God "raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." While Romans 6:4-5 speaks of believers being buried and raised with Christ in baptism, and Colossians 3:1 says "you have been raised with Christ," only Ephesians goes further to say believers are already "seated" with Christ in heavenly places.

This represents the most developed form of realized eschatology in the Pauline letters. In Paul's undisputed letters (Romans, 1-2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, Philemon), resurrection and exaltation remain primarily future realities. Romans 6:5 says "we shall be united with him in a resurrection like his" (future tense), and 1 Corinthians 15 presents resurrection as a future event. Ephesians uniquely declares that believers already participate in Christ's resurrection and enthronement—a present, completed reality, not merely a future hope.

This teaching profoundly affects Christian identity: believers are not merely forgiven sinners on earth but exalted saints already participating in Christ's heavenly reign. The ethical implications are explored in chapters 4-6: those seated with Christ in heavenly places must live accordingly on earth.

### The Church Displaying God's Wisdom to Cosmic Powers

Ephesians 3:10 presents a unique purpose for the church: "so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places." This pedagogical function of the church—teaching angelic beings about God's wisdom—appears nowhere else in Scripture.

While 1 Corinthians 6:3 mentions that saints will judge angels (future), and 1 Peter 1:12 notes that angels long to look into salvation, only Ephesians presents the church as God's present-tense demonstration project to the cosmos. The church, composed of formerly hostile Jews and Gentiles united in Christ, displays to cosmic powers (both good and evil) the wisdom of God's redemptive plan. The church itself becomes a sermon to the spiritual realm.

This teaching elevates ecclesiology to cosmic significance. The local congregation is not merely a gathering of believers but a display of divine wisdom visible to principalities and powers. This explains why church unity (a major Ephesian theme) matters so profoundly: divisions in the church undermine God's cosmic testimony.

### Apostles and Prophets as the Foundation

Ephesians 2:20 states that the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone." This formulation appears to contradict 1 Corinthians 3:11, where Paul writes, "For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."

This difference represents a unique feature of Ephesians' ecclesiology. Rather than Christ being the foundation (1 Corinthians), in Ephesians Christ is the cornerstone while apostles and prophets form the foundation. This may reflect a later stage of church development where apostolic teaching had become foundational to the church's identity. The apostles and prophets who received revelation about God's mystery (Ephesians 3:5) now serve as the foundation of the church's structure, with Christ as the critical cornerstone that holds everything together and determines the building's orientation.

This unique teaching emphasizes the authority of apostolic tradition. The church is not built directly on Christ apart from mediation but on the apostolic testimony to Christ. This became crucial for post-apostolic Christianity: how does the church maintain connection to Christ after the apostles die? Ephesians' answer: through the foundation of apostolic teaching preserved in the church.

### Marriage as a Mystery Referring to Christ and the Church

While various biblical texts use marriage imagery for God's relationship with His people (Hosea, Isaiah 54, 62; Revelation 19:7-9), and while Paul discusses marriage in 1 Corinthians 7, only Ephesians 5:25-32 develops the extended typology of marriage as reflecting Christ's relationship with the church.

After quoting Genesis 2:24 ("Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh"), Paul reveals: "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32). This interpretive move is unique to Ephesians. The letter reads the Genesis account of human marriage as prophetically pointing forward to Christ and the church.

This teaching accomplishes several unique functions:
- It provides the most developed New Testament theology of marriage
- It elevates marriage to a sacramental or mystical significance beyond social convention
- It establishes the husband's role as sacrificial love (like Christ's) rather than domination
- It presents the church as Christ's bride being prepared for presentation to Him

While Revelation 19:7-9 and 21:2, 9 present the church as bride at the eschaton, Ephesians uniquely applies this imagery to present marriage relationships, making every Christian marriage a living parable of Christ and the church.

### The Comprehensive Armor of God

While spiritual warfare appears throughout Scripture, and while other passages mention individual pieces of spiritual armor (1 Thessalonians 5:8 mentions "the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation"), only Ephesians 6:10-17 presents a complete, systematic description of spiritual armor:

1. Belt of truth
2. Breastplate of righteousness
3. Shoes of the gospel of peace
4. Shield of faith
5. Helmet of salvation
6. Sword of the Spirit (the word of God)

This six-piece armor system, drawn from Isaiah 59:17 and other Old Testament warrior imagery, is unique to Ephesians. The passage transformed Christian understanding of spiritual life as warfare. While Paul elsewhere mentions spiritual conflict (2 Corinthians 10:3-5), only Ephesians provides detailed equipment for the battle.

The armor passage is particularly significant given Ephesus's background as a center of magical practices. Rather than engaging spiritual powers through manipulation, incantations, or magical formulae, believers resist them through truth, righteousness, the gospel, faith, salvation assurance, Scripture, and prayer. This presents a radically different paradigm for engaging the spiritual realm—not through secret knowledge or ritual but through moral and theological grounding in the gospel.

### Comprehensive Emphasis on Spiritual Warfare

Related to the armor passage, Ephesians as a whole emphasizes spiritual warfare more comprehensively than any other New Testament book. The theme appears throughout:

- "The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience" (Ephesians 2:2)
- "Give no opportunity to the devil" (Ephesians 4:27)
- Church displaying wisdom "to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 3:10)
- The whole armor passage (Ephesians 6:10-17)
- "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12)

While individual elements appear elsewhere (Satan as enemy, demons, etc.), only Ephesians integrates spiritual warfare as a comprehensive framework for understanding Christian existence. Every chapter touches on spiritual powers, making this emphasis distinctive to Ephesians.

### The Multi-Layered "Mystery"

While Paul uses "mystery" (Greek: *mystērion*) terminology in several letters (Romans 11:25, 16:25; 1 Corinthians 2:7, 4:1, 15:51; Colossians 1:26-27, 2:2, 4:3), Ephesians uses it with unique frequency and in distinctive ways. The word appears six times (Ephesians 1:9, 3:3, 3:4, 3:9, 5:32, 6:19):

- "The mystery of his will" (Ephesians 1:9) – God's plan to unite all things in Christ
- "The mystery of Christ" (Ephesians 3:3-4) – specifically that "the Gentiles are fellow heirs" (Ephesians 3:6)
- "The mystery hidden for ages in God" (Ephesians 3:9)
- "This mystery refers to Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32) – regarding marriage
- "The mystery of the gospel" (Ephesians 6:19)

The unique feature is not merely the frequency but the specific content: while Colossians identifies the mystery primarily as "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27), Ephesians specifically defines it as the inclusion of Gentiles as equal participants in salvation. This precise definition is unique to Ephesians.

### Ephesians' View of the Church's Cosmic Role

Ephesians presents the highest and most developed ecclesiology in the New Testament. Several unique features characterize this:

**The Church as Fullness**: "The church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all" (Ephesians 1:22-23). This paradoxical statement that the church is the "fullness" of Christ who Himself "fills all in all" is unique. It suggests that Christ, though complete in Himself, chooses to manifest His fullness through the church.

**Universal Rather Than Local**: While Paul's undisputed letters focus on local congregations (the church *in* Corinth, Galatia, etc.), Ephesians presents the church as a universal, cosmic entity. This shift from local to universal ecclesiology is distinctive.

**Three Metaphors in One Book**: Ephesians uniquely combines three major church metaphors in one letter:
- The church as Christ's body (Ephesians 1:22-23, 4:12, 5:23)
- The church as God's temple/building (Ephesians 2:19-22)
- The church as Christ's bride (Ephesians 5:25-32)

While these metaphors appear individually elsewhere, only Ephesians combines all three, presenting a multi-faceted ecclesiology.

### "Before the Foundation of the World"

While predestination and election appear in Romans 8-9, only Ephesians uses the specific phrase "before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4): "even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him." This temporal marker—election occurring before creation—emphasizes the primacy and eternality of God's saving plan more explicitly than any other New Testament text.

### Why These Unique Teachings Matter

These distinctive teachings of Ephesians have profoundly shaped Christian theology:

- The "heavenly places" concept influences charismatic and spiritual warfare movements
- Realized eschatology affects Christian identity and confidence
- The church displaying wisdom to cosmic powers elevates ecclesiology
- Marriage as Christ/church mystery shapes Christian marriage theology
- The armor of God provides a foundational framework for spiritual warfare teaching
- The comprehensive emphasis on spiritual warfare informs deliverance ministries
- The "before the foundation of the world" teaching grounds assurance of salvation

Ephesians' unique contributions make it indispensable for comprehensive Christian theology, adding dimensions absent from the rest of the New Testament canon.

## Textual Variants

Like all ancient documents, Ephesians exists in numerous manuscript copies that occasionally differ in wording. These textual variants—differences between manuscripts—provide valuable evidence for understanding the letter's transmission history and original text. Most variants in Ephesians are minor (spelling differences, word order, etc.), but several significant variants affect interpretation.

### Ephesians 1:1: "In Ephesus"

The most important and widely debated textual variant in Ephesians concerns the letter's destination. The phrase "in Ephesus" (Greek: *en Ephesō*) in verse 1:1 is absent from several of the earliest and most reliable manuscripts:

**Manuscripts Omitting "in Ephesus":**
- **P46** (Papyrus 46, c. AD 200): The earliest substantial manuscript of Ephesians omits the phrase
- **א\*** (Codex Sinaiticus, original hand, 4th century): Does not contain "in Ephesus"
- **B\*** (Codex Vaticanus, original hand, 4th century): Omits the phrase
- **Manuscript 1739** (10th century, but based on a very early exemplar): Lacks the phrase
- **Manuscript 424c**: Omits it

**Manuscripts Including "in Ephesus":**
- **א²** (Codex Sinaiticus, later correction): A corrector added the phrase
- **A** (Codex Alexandrinus, 5th century): Includes it
- **B²** (Codex Vaticanus, later correction): Added by a corrector
- **D** (Codex Claromontanus, 6th century): Contains it
- **F, G**: Include the phrase
- **Most later manuscripts**: Have "in Ephesus"

**Patristic Evidence:**
- **Origen** (c. AD 185-254): Knew manuscripts without the phrase and commented on its absence
- **Basil of Caesarea** (c. AD 329-379): Explicitly states that ancient copies did not have "in Ephesus" and that the text originally read "to the saints who are and are faithful in Christ Jesus," making a theological point about believers being "those who are"
- **Tertullian** (c. AD 160-225): Knew the letter but his evidence is less clear

**Scholarly Consensus:**
The overwhelming majority of textual critics conclude that "in Ephesus" is not original to the text. The combination of the earliest papyrus (P46), the two best uncial manuscripts in their original hands (א B), and patristic testimony creates a strong case for the shorter reading. The phrase was likely added by scribes who knew the letter circulated to Ephesus and wanted to clarify the destination.

**Implications:**
This variant strongly supports the circular letter theory discussed in the Historical Environment section. The original text likely read: "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are [___] and faithful in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 1:1), with a blank space where local church names could be inserted during public reading. This explains:
- Why the letter lacks personal greetings despite Paul's three-year ministry in Ephesus
- Why the content is generic rather than addressing specific local issues
- Why Paul writes "I have heard of your faith" (Ephesians 1:15), unusual if writing to a church where he ministered extensively

**Modern Translations:**
- Most translations include "in Ephesus" in the text but note the variant in footnotes
- Some translations bracket the phrase to indicate its textual uncertainty
- Example (ESV): "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus" with a footnote: "Some manuscripts lack in Ephesus"

### Ephesians 5:30: "Of His Flesh and of His Bones"

A significant variant exists in Ephesians 5:30, where some manuscripts contain a longer reading:

**Shorter Reading** (adopted by most modern translations):
"For we are members of his body" (Ephesians 5:30)

**Longer Reading** (found in some manuscripts):
"For we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones"

**Manuscript Evidence:**
- The longer reading appears in later Byzantine manuscripts and is reflected in the Textus Receptus (the Greek text underlying the King James Version)
- The shorter reading is supported by earlier manuscripts including **P46**, **א**, **B**, **A**, and others
- External evidence strongly favors the shorter reading

**Origin of the Longer Reading:**
The phrase "of his flesh and of his bones" likely represents a scribal addition influenced by Genesis 2:23, where Adam says of Eve: "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh." Given that Ephesians 5:31 quotes Genesis 2:24 in the following verse, a scribe may have harmonized verse 30 with the Genesis narrative, emphasizing the church's intimate connection to Christ parallel to Eve's connection to Adam.

**Implications:**
- The longer reading doesn't significantly change the meaning—it merely emphasizes the point Paul already makes
- It demonstrates how scribes sometimes added clarifying or harmonizing material
- Modern critical editions (NA28, UBS5) adopt the shorter reading based on manuscript evidence

**Translation Differences:**
- **KJV** (based on Textus Receptus): "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones"
- **ESV, NIV, NASB** (based on critical texts): "For we are members of his body"

### Other Notable Variants

**Ephesians 1:15:**
Some manuscripts read "your love" while others omit this phrase, leaving only "faith in the Lord Jesus." The manuscript evidence is divided, though many critical editions include "your love" based on strong early witnesses. This affects whether Paul mentions both faith and love or faith alone.

**Ephesians 4:28:**
Minor variation exists in the wording about working and sharing with those in need, but no significant meaning changes result.

**Ephesians 5:9:**
Some manuscripts read "fruit of the Spirit" while others read "fruit of the light." Given the context ("walk as children of light," Ephesians 5:8), "fruit of the light" better fits and has strong manuscript support, though "Spirit" appears in some manuscripts, likely by assimilation to Galatians 5:22.

**Ephesians 6:12:**
Minor variations exist in the list of spiritual enemies (rulers, authorities, cosmic powers, spiritual forces), but these don't significantly affect meaning.

### Manuscript Witnesses for Ephesians

The text of Ephesians is preserved in numerous Greek manuscripts:

**Major Papyri:**
- **P46** (Chester Beatty Papyrus II, c. AD 200): Contains Ephesians 1-6 and is one of our earliest and most valuable witnesses to the Pauline epistles

**Major Uncial Manuscripts:**
- **א** (Codex Sinaiticus, 4th century): Complete text of Ephesians
- **B** (Codex Vaticanus, 4th century): Contains Ephesians
- **A** (Codex Alexandrinus, 5th century): Includes Ephesians
- **D** (Codex Claromontanus, 6th century): Contains the Pauline epistles including Ephesians

**Text Types:**
Ephesians manuscripts generally follow the major text types:
- **Alexandrian text** (P46, א, B, A): Generally considered the most reliable
- **Western text** (D): Sometimes differs from Alexandrian
- **Byzantine text** (majority of later manuscripts): Represents the standardized medieval text

### Quality of the Ephesians Text

Despite these variants, the text of Ephesians is remarkably well preserved:

**High Degree of Certainty:**
- Approximately 98-99% of the text is certain
- No major doctrine is affected by textual variants
- Most variants involve minor issues (spelling, word order, articles)
- The significant variants (Ephesians 1:1, 5:30) are clearly identified and documented

**Early Manuscript Evidence:**
Ephesians benefits from very early manuscript attestation (P46 from c. AD 200), providing a text only about 100-150 years removed from the original. This is exceptionally close for ancient literature.

**Manuscript Abundance:**
Ephesians exists in thousands of Greek manuscripts, versions in other languages (Latin, Syriac, Coptic, etc.), and quotations in church fathers' writings, providing overwhelming evidence for reconstructing the original text.

### Conclusion

The textual variants in Ephesians, while fascinating for scholarly study, do not undermine the reliability of the letter. The most significant variant (Ephesians 1:1) actually illuminates our understanding of the letter's original purpose as a circular epistle. Modern critical editions carefully document all significant variants, allowing readers to make informed judgments about the original text. The remarkable agreement among manuscripts on the vast majority of the text testifies to the careful transmission of Ephesians through the centuries.

## Textual Errors

Scholars have identified several passages in Ephesians where the text appears to contain errors, discrepancies, or problematic quotations. These issues fall primarily into three categories: apparent misquotations of the Old Testament, quotations from unknown sources, and potential factual inaccuracies. While conservative scholars offer explanations that preserve biblical reliability, critical scholars view these as evidence of human authorship and transmission errors.

### Ephesians 4:8: Misquotation of Psalm 68:18?

The most discussed textual problem in Ephesians concerns the quotation in Ephesians 4:8. Paul writes: "Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.'"

**The Problem:**
Psalm 68:18 in the Hebrew Masoretic Text reads: "You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there."

The critical difference: Psalm 68:18 says God "received gifts," while Ephesians 4:8 says he "gave gifts." This represents an apparent reversal of meaning that has troubled scholars since antiquity. Additionally, Ephesians changes "receiving gifts among men" to "gave gifts to men."

**Ancient Recognition:**
Scholar Ferdinand Christian Baur noted in the 19th century that this quotation doesn't fit the surrounding context properly, suggesting the author may have misunderstood or misapplied the psalm.

**Scholarly Explanations:**

**1. Aramaic Targum Tradition:**
The most common explanation is that Paul (or the author of Ephesians) quotes from the Aramaic Targum on Psalms rather than the Hebrew text. The Targum, a Jewish translation and paraphrase into Aramaic, interprets Psalm 68:18 with "You have given gifts to men" rather than "received." In the Targum tradition, the concept is that God receives tribute from conquered enemies in order to distribute it as gifts to His people. Ephesians may be following this interpretive tradition.

**2. Theological Interpretation:**
Some scholars argue Paul is not directly quoting Psalm 68:18 but applying its narrative movement theologically. The psalm depicts a conquering warrior who ascends to his throne after victory. God receives tribute/gifts from defeated enemies, which He then distributes to His people. Paul interprets this two-stage process (receiving, then giving) and applies the result to Christ's ascension. Christ conquers, receives all authority, and then gives gifts (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers) to the church.

**3. Intertextuality Problem:**
Critical scholars like those who discuss intertextuality note that "this is one of the most difficult citations in Ephesians because of interpretive problems." Some suggest Paul (or the author) may have inserted his own word, causing an intertextuality issue where the quotation doesn't match the source.

**4. Messianic Interpretation:**
Early Christian interpreters read Psalm 68 messianically. The psalm's warrior-king ascending the mountain becomes Christ ascending to heaven. The application involves creative interpretation—transforming a description of God receiving tribute into Christ giving gifts to His church.

**Conservative Response:**
Defenders of biblical inerrancy point out that:
- Ancient Jewish interpretation (Targum) already made this shift
- Paul is interpreting, not merely quoting
- The New Testament frequently applies Old Testament texts in creative, Spirit-guided ways
- Early manuscripts consistently contain this reading, indicating it's not a later corruption

**Critical Perspective:**
Critical scholars view this as evidence that:
- The author had access to Aramaic traditions
- Early Christian interpreters freely adapted Old Testament texts for theological purposes
- This represents interpretive liberty rather than strict quotation
- It may indicate Ephesians was written after Paul by someone less careful with quotations

### Ephesians 5:14: Quotation from an Unknown Source

Ephesians 5:14 introduces a quotation with the formula "Therefore it says": "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."

**The Problem:**
No Old Testament passage matches this quotation. The closest parallel is Isaiah 60:1: "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you." However, the differences are substantial:
- Isaiah says "Arise, shine" while Ephesians says "Awake, O sleeper"
- Isaiah mentions "your light has come" while Ephesians says "Christ will shine on you"
- Ephesians adds "arise from the dead," not found in Isaiah
- The phrase about "Christ" obviously doesn't appear in Isaiah

**Historical Discussion:**
The church father Epiphanius (4th century) discussed this passage, noting its problematic nature. The passage has puzzled interpreters for centuries.

**Scholarly Explanations:**

**1. Early Christian Hymn (Most Common):**
The broad scholarly consensus is that Ephesians 5:14 quotes an early Christian hymn or liturgical formula, not an Old Testament text. The poetic structure, baptismal imagery ("arise from the dead," "Christ will shine on you"), and rhythmic quality suggest liturgical use. This may have been a hymn sung at baptisms, calling converts to awaken from spiritual death.

**2. Conflation of Multiple Passages:**
Some scholars argue the quotation amalgamates multiple Old Testament texts:
- Isaiah 26:19: "Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise"
- Isaiah 51:17: "Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem"
- Isaiah 52:1: "Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion"
- Isaiah 60:1: "Arise, shine, for your light has come"

The author may have blended these awakening/arising passages into a composite quotation adapted to Christian theology.

**3. Lost Apocryphal Source:**
Some ancient commentators suggested the words come from "an apocryphal book of Jeremiah, or from some writing now lost." While possible, no evidence supports this theory.

**4. Free Paraphrase:**
Some argue Paul (or the author) didn't intend to quote any specific text but was giving "the spirit of the passage" rather than exact words, freely adapting awakening language from Isaiah to Christian purposes.

**5. Non-Canonical Christian Text:**
The quotation may come from an early Christian prophetic utterance, a saying of Jesus not recorded in the Gospels, or another early Christian text that didn't become canonical.

**Conservative Response:**
Conservative scholars typically adopt the early Christian hymn theory, noting that:
- The quotation formula "Therefore it says" doesn't always introduce Old Testament quotations (it can introduce any authoritative saying)
- Early Christian prophecy and hymns had authority in the apostolic church
- The verse fits perfectly in context as baptismal liturgy
- This doesn't constitute an error but reflects the diversity of early Christian literature

**Critical Perspective:**
Critical scholars view this as evidence that:
- The author of Ephesians had access to early Christian liturgical traditions
- The author treated Christian liturgical material as having scriptural authority
- This reflects a later stage of church development where Christian liturgy was established
- The misattribution (or vague attribution) suggests the author was uncertain of the source

### Ephesians 6:2-3: "The First Commandment with a Promise"

Ephesians 6:2-3 quotes the fifth commandment: "'Honor your father and mother' (this is the first commandment with a promise), 'that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.'"

**The Problem:**
Ephesians calls this "the first commandment with a promise," but this description is questionable:

1. **Not Literally First:** The fifth commandment is not the *first* commandment in the Decalogue—four commandments precede it. If "first" means "first in order," this is factually incorrect.

2. **Not the Only Commandment with a Promise:** The second commandment (Exodus 20:5-6) also contains a promise: God shows "steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments." Critics argue this makes the description in Ephesians inaccurate.

**Scholarly Explanations:**

**1. "First" Means "Foremost" or "Primary":**
Many scholars interpret "first" (Greek: *prōtē*) as meaning "foremost" or "primary" rather than "first in sequence." The commandment to honor parents is the first (most important) commandment concerning human relationships that includes an explicit promise of blessing.

**2. First of the "Second Table":**
The Decalogue is traditionally divided into two "tables"—commandments relating to God (1-4) and commandments relating to humans (5-10). The fifth commandment is the first of the human-relations commandments with a promise, making the description accurate within this framework.

**3. Most Prominent Promise:**
While the second commandment contains a promise, it's stated negatively (God visits iniquity) and then positively (showing steadfast love). The fifth commandment's promise is more direct, explicit, and positive—making it the "first" in the sense of "primary" or "most clear."

**4. Jewish Interpretive Tradition:**
Some argue this reflects Jewish interpretive tradition that particularly emphasized the fifth commandment's promise as unique or primary among the commandments.

**5. Translation Nuance:**
The Greek word *prōtē* can mean "first" in various senses—first in time, first in rank, first in importance. The author may intentionally use it in the sense of "preeminent" rather than "first in order."

**Conservative Response:**
Defenders argue:
- "First" clearly means "primary" or "most prominent" in context
- Ancient readers would have understood this as referring to prominence, not sequence
- The description is accurate when properly understood
- This is standard ancient rhetoric, not an error

**Critical Perspective:**
Critics suggest:
- This may reflect imprecise knowledge of the Decalogue
- The author may have carelessly described the commandment
- It could indicate the author is not Paul (who was trained as a Pharisee and would know the commandments precisely)
- At minimum, it's an ambiguous statement that could mislead readers

### Additional Observations on Quotation Practices

**Flexibility in Ancient Quotation:**
It's important to note that ancient standards for quotation differed significantly from modern expectations. Ancient authors regularly:
- Quoted from memory rather than consulting written texts
- Adapted quotations to fit their arguments
- Combined multiple passages
- Interpreted while quoting
- Used paraphrase freely

What modern readers might consider "errors" were standard practices in ancient literature. The question becomes: Should the New Testament be held to modern standards of precision, or should it be evaluated by ancient standards?

**Theological Rather Than Archival Purpose:**
The New Testament writers, including the author of Ephesians, were primarily concerned with theological meaning and application rather than archival accuracy. Their goal was to demonstrate how Old Testament texts found fulfillment and meaning in Christ, not to provide exact quotations for academic purposes.

### Conclusion

The textual issues in Ephesians—particularly the Psalm 68:18 quotation and the unknown source in Ephesians 5:14—illustrate the complexity of how New Testament authors used Jewish Scripture and early Christian traditions. Whether viewed as errors, interpretive adaptations, or Spirit-guided applications depends largely on one's approach to biblical authority and ancient quotation practices. Conservative scholars generally find satisfactory explanations that preserve biblical reliability, while critical scholars see evidence of human authorship and the historical development of early Christianity. Both perspectives acknowledge that Ephesians engages Scripture and tradition in sophisticated, sometimes complex ways that reward careful study.

## Contradictions

Scholars have identified several apparent contradictions between Ephesians and other biblical books, as well as internal tensions within Ephesians itself. These contradictions fall into theological, ecclesiological, and eschatological categories. Conservative scholars typically offer harmonizing explanations, while critical scholars view these as evidence of different authorship or theological development.

### Ephesians 2:8-9 vs. James 2:24: Salvation by Faith or Works?

**The Contradiction:**
Ephesians 2:8-9 states unambiguously: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

James 2:24 declares: "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone."

These statements appear directly contradictory: Ephesians says salvation is "not a result of works," while James says justification comes "by works and not by faith alone."

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Different Meanings of "Works":**
Ephesians 2:8-9 refers to "works" as human attempts to earn salvation through law-keeping or meritorious deeds. James 2:24 refers to "works" as the fruit or evidence of genuine faith. Ephesians addresses the basis of salvation (grace alone), while James addresses the proof of salvation (faith produces works).

**2. Different Meanings of "Faith":**
Ephesians speaks of genuine, saving faith. James addresses dead, intellectual faith—mere mental assent without life transformation. James' point is that such faith is not genuine saving faith at all (James 2:17: "faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead").

**3. Complementary, Not Contradictory:**
Ephesians 2:10 immediately follows verses 8-9: "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them." Ephesians and James together present a complete picture: salvation is by grace through faith (Ephesians), which inevitably produces good works (James). The works don't save but demonstrate salvation.

**4. Different Audiences:**
Ephesians addresses Gentiles tempted to think they must keep Jewish law to be saved. James addresses Jewish Christians in danger of antinomianism—thinking faith requires no lifestyle changes. Each corrects a different error.

**Critical Perspective:**
Critical scholars note that:
- This tension has divided Protestant and Catholic theology for centuries
- Luther famously called James "an epistle of straw" because of this apparent contradiction
- Different New Testament authors may have genuinely held different views on the faith-works relationship
- This reflects theological diversity in early Christianity

### Ephesians 2:20 vs. 1 Corinthians 3:11: What Is the Church's Foundation?

**The Contradiction:**
Ephesians 2:20 states: "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone."

1 Corinthians 3:11 declares: "For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."

Ephesians makes apostles and prophets the foundation with Christ as cornerstone, while 1 Corinthians makes Christ himself the foundation. These appear mutually exclusive.

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Different Architectural Metaphors:**
Ancient buildings had both a foundation (the base layer) and a cornerstone (the critical stone that aligned and held the structure together). Ephesians and 1 Corinthians use different aspects of building imagery for different purposes. In 1 Corinthians, Paul emphasizes that Christ is the essential basis of the church—no other foundation is possible. In Ephesians, the focus is on how the church is built: on the apostolic testimony to Christ, with Christ as the cornerstone that determines the building's alignment.

**2. Foundation of Teaching:**
Ephesians 2:20 refers to the apostolic and prophetic teaching about Christ as the church's doctrinal foundation. The apostles and prophets who received and proclaimed revelation about God's mystery (Ephesians 3:5) provide the foundational teaching. Christ is both the content of that teaching (the cornerstone) and its ultimate ground (the foundation in 1 Corinthians).

**3. Chronological Development:**
Critical scholars suggest Ephesians reflects a later stage of church development (post-apostolic) when the church needed to ground its authority in apostolic tradition after the apostles died. First Corinthians, written during Paul's lifetime, could simply point to Christ. Ephesians, possibly written after Paul's death, needed to establish how post-apostolic churches remain connected to Christ—through apostolic teaching.

**4. Complementary Truths:**
Both statements can be true from different perspectives. Christ is ultimately the foundation (1 Corinthians), but the church is built on apostolic testimony to Christ (Ephesians). You can't have the church without Christ, and you can't know Christ apart from apostolic witness.

**Critical Perspective:**
This difference, combined with stylistic and theological differences, contributes to the majority scholarly view that Ephesians was written by someone other than Paul, possibly a disciple writing in Paul's name and adapting his theology for a new situation.

### Ephesians 2:5-6 vs. Romans 6:5 and 1 Corinthians 15: Resurrection Now or Future?

**The Contradiction:**
Ephesians 2:5-6 states: "even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ... and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

Romans 6:5 says: "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his" (future tense).

1 Corinthians 15:51-52: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed" (future resurrection).

Ephesians presents believers as already raised and seated with Christ (past tense, realized eschatology), while Paul's undisputed letters present resurrection as future.

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Positional vs. Physical:**
Ephesians 2:5-6 refers to spiritual, positional reality—believers' status before God. Romans 6 and 1 Corinthians 15 refer to physical, bodily resurrection. Both are true: believers are already spiritually resurrected (new birth, new creation) but await physical resurrection at Christ's return.

**2. Already/Not Yet Tension:**
New Testament theology holds resurrection in tension: already inaugurated but not yet consummated. Believers participate in Christ's resurrection life now (Ephesians) but await full manifestation later (1 Corinthians 15). This is standard "already/not yet" eschatology.

**3. Development of Thought:**
If Paul wrote Ephesians late in life, his theology may have developed. Early letters emphasize future hope; later letters (Ephesians, if Pauline) emphasize present realities. This is natural theological maturation, not contradiction.

**4. Different Rhetorical Purposes:**
First Corinthians addresses believers denying future bodily resurrection, so Paul emphasizes the future. Ephesians addresses believers needing assurance of their present status in Christ, so it emphasizes realized benefits. Each letter addresses different pastoral needs.

**Critical Perspective:**
This eschatological shift is one of the strongest arguments for deutero-Pauline authorship:
- Paul's theology in undisputed letters maintains future eschatological tension
- Ephesians' realized eschatology reflects theological development beyond Paul
- The shift from imminent expectation (1 Thessalonians) to settled church order (Ephesians) suggests considerable time elapsed
- This represents the church adapting to the delay of the Parousia (Second Coming)

### Ephesians 3:6 vs. Colossians 1:27: What Is "The Mystery"?

**The Contradiction:**
Ephesians 3:6 defines the mystery: "This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel."

Colossians 1:27 defines it differently: "To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."

Ephesians identifies the mystery as Gentile inclusion; Colossians identifies it as "Christ in you."

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Complementary Aspects:**
These are not contradictory but complementary. "Christ in you" (Colossians) is the reality; "Gentiles as fellow heirs" (Ephesians) is the surprising application of that reality. The mystery is that Christ dwells not only in Jews but in Gentiles, making them equal participants in salvation.

**2. Different Emphases:**
Colossians emphasizes the personal/indiv idual aspect (Christ in you), while Ephesians emphasizes the corporate/communal aspect (Gentiles together with Jews in one body). Same mystery, different angles.

**3. Development of Theme:**
Ephesians may be expanding and clarifying the mystery mentioned in Colossians. If Ephesians was written after Colossians (whether by Paul or another), it makes explicit what Colossians left implicit.

**Critical Perspective:**
The different formulations support the theory that Ephesians used Colossians as a source but adapted and expanded its themes for a different context and audience.

### Ephesians 5:22-24 vs. Galatians 3:28: Submission or Equality?

**The Contradiction:**
Ephesians 5:22-24 commands: "Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands."

Galatians 3:28 declares: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."

Ephesians maintains hierarchical gender roles, while Galatians announces radical equality. These seem contradictory.

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Positional vs. Functional:**
Galatians 3:28 addresses positional equality before God—all are equally saved, equally children of God, equally heirs. Ephesians 5 addresses functional roles within marriage and family. Position can be equal while functions differ.

**2. Mutual Submission Framework:**
Ephesians 5:21 introduces the household code with "submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ." This mutual submission framework qualifies what follows. Additionally, husbands receive the more demanding command—to love as Christ loved the church (sacrificial, self-giving love unto death). This is hardly patriarchal domination.

**3. Cultural Accommodation:**
The household codes (Ephesians 5:21-6:9) represent Christian adaptation to Greco-Roman household structures while subtly subverting them. The commands to husbands (sacrificial love), masters (treat slaves justly, knowing God shows no partiality), and fathers (don't provoke children) were radical in their context. Paul works within existing structures while transforming them from within.

**4. Different Contexts:**
Galatians addresses who can be saved and how (not by Jewish law but by faith). Ephesians addresses how Christians should conduct family life. These are different questions.

**Critical Perspective:**
Critical scholars note:
- Galatians represents Paul's radical theological vision
- The household codes represent accommodation to society, possibly added by later editors or reflecting deutero-Pauline conservatism
- This tension reflects the church's struggle between radical gospel implications and social survival
- The household codes in Ephesians, Colossians, 1 Peter, and the Pastorals represent a domestication of Paul's original radicalism

### Ephesians' Universal Church vs. Paul's Local Churches

**The Contradiction:**
Throughout Paul's undisputed letters, "church" (Greek: *ekklēsia*) refers to local congregations: "the church of God that is in Corinth" (1 Corinthians 1:2), "the churches of Galatia" (Galatians 1:2), "the church of the Thessalonians" (1 Thessalonians 1:1). Paul uses plural "churches" frequently.

Ephesians consistently uses "church" (singular) to refer to a universal, cosmic entity: "the church, which is his body" (Ephesians 1:22-23), "Christ loved the church" (Ephesians 5:25), etc. This represents a significant shift in ecclesiology.

**Harmonizing Explanations:**

**1. Both Uses Are Valid:**
Paul can speak of church locally (particular congregations) and universally (all believers everywhere). Both concepts exist in Paul's thought. Ephesians simply emphasizes the universal aspect because of its theological focus.

**2. Theological Development:**
As Paul's ministry progressed and he saw churches established throughout the Mediterranean, his ecclesiology naturally expanded from thinking primarily about local assemblies to contemplating the universal body of Christ.

**3. Different Literary Purposes:**
Paul's earlier letters address specific local problems (factions in Corinth, Judaizers in Galatia), requiring focus on local congregations. Ephesians, as a circular letter presenting systematic theology, naturally emphasizes the universal church.

**Critical Perspective:**
This shift from local to universal ecclesiology is another indicator of deutero-Pauline authorship:
- Paul's undisputed letters focus on local communities
- Ephesians' universal ecclesiology reflects later theological development
- The emphasis on church as cosmic entity suggests second-generation Christian reflection
- This represents the church developing institutional self-understanding beyond the apostolic period

### Additional Tensions

**Eschatological Urgency:**
Paul's early letters convey imminent expectation of Christ's return (1 Thessalonians 4:15: "we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord"). Ephesians shows no such urgency, instead emphasizing the church's ongoing role in displaying God's wisdom (Ephesians 3:10) and settled family/work structures (Ephesians 5-6). This suggests either theological development or different authorship.

**Role of the Law:**
Paul's undisputed letters extensively discuss the Jewish law's role (Romans, Galatians). Ephesians mentions it only briefly (Ephesians 2:15) without the detailed argumentation found in Romans or Galatians. This shift may reflect a predominantly Gentile audience for whom law debates were no longer central.

### Conclusion

The contradictions between Ephesians and other biblical books range from apparent to substantive. Conservative scholars generally find harmonizing explanations that preserve both Pauline authorship and biblical consistency. Critical scholars view these contradictions as evidence of different authorship, theological development within early Christianity, or both.

The interpretation one adopts depends on broader theological commitments: whether Scripture must be entirely consistent, whether theological development over time is acceptable, and whether pseudonymous authorship (writing in Paul's name after his death) is compatible with biblical authority. Both harmonizing and critical approaches acknowledge the real differences and offer frameworks for understanding them. The careful student of Scripture benefits from understanding both perspectives and wrestling honestly with the tensions the text presents.
