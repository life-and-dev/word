# Job

## Authorship

The Book of Job is anonymous, with no author explicitly identified within the text. Traditional attributions have varied, including Moses, Job himself, or Solomon.

Modern scholarship agrees that the author is unknown and that no consensus exists on the precise time of composition, although the work demonstrates sophisticated literary craftsmanship and deep theological reflection. The linguistic analysis, revealing post-Babylonian Hebrew with significant Aramaic influences, suggests composition during the Persian period (540-330 BCE). The speeches of Elihu (chapters 32-37) are often considered a later addition due to their differing style and the fact that neither God nor Job acknowledge them.

The author, an Israelite, likely wrote from within the land of Israel, intending the work for a broad audience grappling with fundamental questions about suffering and divine justice. For more information, see [Bible Odyssey - Authorship of Job](https://www.bibleodyssey.org/) and [Wikipedia - Book of Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job).

## Historical Environment

The Book of Job is set in the patriarchal era (c. 2100-1900 BCE), as suggested by internal clues like Job's longevity and the absence of Mosaic Law. However, linguistic evidence points to a much later composition date, likely during the Persian period (c. 540-330 BCE). The book was written by an unknown Israelite author, probably in the Persian province of Yehud, for a Jewish audience grappling with the theological crisis of the Babylonian exile. The narrative deliberately uses a non-Israelite setting (the land of Uz) to explore universal questions of suffering and divine justice, challenging the simplistic retribution theology that was shaken by the destruction of Jerusalem. The work engages with ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions while providing a distinctively Israelite perspective.

## Purpose

The Book of Job serves multiple interconnected purposes:

**1. Theodicy and the Problem of Evil:** Job represents one of the earliest sustained philosophical investigations into theodicy—why a good and powerful God permits evil and suffering to exist. The book directly confronts the question: "Why do the righteous suffer?"

**2. Challenging Retribution Theology:** The author explicitly challenges the dominant wisdom theology of automatic divine retribution—the belief that good things invariably happen to good people while bad things befall the wicked. Job's experience demonstrates that this equation is overly simplistic and often false.

**3. Critiquing False Comfort:** Through the speeches of Job's three friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar), the author critiques religious leaders who offer facile explanations for suffering, insisting that sufferers must have sinned to deserve their fate. Job's protests represent "one of the most radical restatements of Israelite theology in the Hebrew Bible."

**4. Affirming Divine Mystery:** Rather than providing neat answers, the book ultimately affirms that divine wisdom remains inaccessible to humans. God's speeches from the whirlwind neither explain Job's suffering nor defend divine justice; instead, they emphasize God's transcendent power and wisdom beyond human comprehension.

**5. Pastoral Care:** The book teaches that suffering doesn't always result from sin, and that we shouldn't assume someone is a bad person simply because they experience hardship. This provides crucial pastoral guidance for communities dealing with suffering.

## Cross-References

The Book of Job is referenced relatively sparingly in other biblical texts compared to books like Psalms or Isaiah.

**New Testament References:**

1. **1 Corinthians 3:19** - Paul quotes Job 5:13: "He catches the wise in their craftiness." This quotation is introduced with a formula indicating Paul considered Job canonical Scripture.

2. **Romans 11:35** - Paul alludes to Job 41:11: "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?"

3. **James 5:11** - The only New Testament passage to mention Job by name: "You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy." James treats Job as a real historical figure whose steadfastness exemplifies patient endurance.

**Old Testament Cross-References:**

There are approximately **65 passages** where Job is quoted or alluded to in other Old Testament books:
- **37 references in Psalms** - Particularly psalms dealing with suffering and divine justice
- **18 references in Proverbs** - Though Proverbs and Job sometimes reach opposite conclusions
- **9 references in the Prophets** - Including Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel

**Notable Absence:** Jesus never quotes from Job or makes clear allusions to the book in the Gospel accounts.

## Canonical Status

The Book of Job has enjoyed uncontested canonical status from the earliest recoverable evidence of canonical discussions.

**Early Canonical Recognition:**

1. **Hebrew Bible Placement:** Job appears in the Ketuvim ("Writings") section of the Hebrew Bible, grouped with wisdom literature. No evidence exists that Judaism ever questioned its canonical status.

2. **New Testament Evidence:** Paul's citation of Job 5:13 in 1 Corinthians 3:19, introduced with a formula indicating scriptural authority, demonstrates Job was considered canonical Scripture by the first century CE.

3. **Early Christian Acceptance:** From the earliest Old Testament canonical lists in Christianity, Job has been consistently included without dispute.

4. **Rabbinic Tradition:** While some rabbinic discussions debated whether certain books (like Esther or Song of Songs) should be included in the canon, Job was never seriously questioned.

**Scholarly Evidence for Canonicity:**

The fact that no ancient sources record debates over Job's canonical status suggests it was recognized as authoritative relatively early. Unlike books such as Esther (which lacks any mention of God) or Song of Songs (which some found too sensual), Job's explicit theological focus and treatment of fundamental religious questions made its inclusion uncontroversial.

**Rare Exception:** Theodore of Mopsuestia (4th-5th century CE) notably omitted Job (along with Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Ezra-Nehemiah) from his personal canon, seeking to obtain exactly 22 books. However, this represented an isolated individual opinion rejected by the broader church.

**Why Job Was Included:**
- Its profound theological engagement with divine justice and human suffering
- Its literary excellence and philosophical depth
- Its treatment of universal religious questions
- Its consistency with core Israelite monotheism despite challenging simplistic theology
- Early recognition as authoritative wisdom literature

## Summary

The Book of Job stands as one of the most profound explorations of human suffering and divine justice in ancient literature. This summary pays special attention to God's direct words and the inspired teachings throughout the narrative.

**The Prologue in Heaven ([Job 1:1-2:13):**

The book opens by introducing Job, a man from the land of Uz, described as "blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil" ([Job 1:1). Job enjoyed extraordinary prosperity: seven sons, three daughters, 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 donkeys, and many servants ([Job 1:2-3).

The scene shifts to the heavenly court, where **God Himself speaks** to the accuser (Satan): "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil" ([Job 1:8). This divine testimony establishes Job's righteousness as God-affirmed, not merely human opinion.

The accuser challenges Job's motives, suggesting he serves God only because of divine protection and blessing. **God permits** the accuser to test Job, first by destroying his possessions and children, then by afflicting his body—but commanding: "he is in your hands; but you must spare his life" ([Job 2:6).

Job loses everything catastrophically: raiding parties steal his livestock, fire consumes his sheep and servants, and a windstorm kills all his children. Yet Job's response demonstrates profound faith: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised" ([Job 1:21). The narrator confirms: "In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing" ([Job 1:22).

In the second test, Job is afflicted with painful sores from head to foot. His wife urges him to "curse God and die," but Job responds: "Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" ([Job 2:9-10). Again, Scripture records: "In all this, Job did not sin in what he said" ([Job 2:10).

**The Dialogues ([Job 3:1-31:40):**

Job breaks the seven-day silence with a lament, cursing the day of his birth ([Job 3:1-26). This initiates three cycles of dialogue between Job and his three friends: Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

*First Cycle (Chapters 4-14):*
Eliphaz opens by gently suggesting Job must have sinned: "Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished?" ([Job 4:7). He claims divine revelation through a night vision, reporting the message: "Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?" ([Job 4:17).

Job responds by asserting his innocence while acknowledging God's overwhelming power: "Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy" ([Job 9:15). He boldly states: "I will say to God: Do not declare me guilty, but tell me what charges you have against me" ([Job 10:2).

*Second Cycle (Chapters 15-21):*
The friends intensify their accusations. Eliphaz questions Job's wisdom: "Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?" ([Job 15:7). Bildad insists the wicked always suffer.

Job maintains his innocence and makes one of Scripture's most remarkable statements of faith: "I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!" ([Job 19:25-27). This prophetic statement points beyond the immediate narrative toward resurrection hope.

*Third Cycle (Chapters 22-31):*
Eliphaz now directly accuses Job of specific sins: oppressing the poor, denying water to the thirsty, and withholding food from the hungry ([Job 22:5-9).

Job responds with an extended oath of innocence (chapters 29-31), cataloging his righteous deeds and calling for God to answer him: "Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me" ([Job 31:35).

**Elihu's Speeches ([Job 32:1-37:24):**

A young man named Elihu, previously unmentioned, suddenly appears and delivers four speeches. Angry at both Job (for justifying himself rather than God) and the three friends (for condemning Job without adequate answers), Elihu attempts a different approach.

Elihu emphasizes that God speaks to humans through various means—dreams, visions, and suffering itself—to turn them from sin: "For God does speak—now one way, now another—though no one perceives it" ([Job 33:14). He argues that God is greater than humans and not obligated to explain His actions: "Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one's words?" ([Job 33:13).

**God's Speeches from the Whirlwind ([Job 38:1-42:6):**

Finally, **the LORD Himself answers Job from a storm**, fundamentally reorienting the entire discussion. Notably, God neither explains Job's suffering nor defends His justice. Instead, He demonstrates His transcendent wisdom and power through a series of penetrating questions.

*First Divine Speech (38:1-40:2):*
**God speaks:** "Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me" ([Job 38:2-3).

**God's questions** survey creation's wonders:
- "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand" ([Job 38:4)
- "Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place?" ([Job 38:12)
- "Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?" ([Job 38:16)
- "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion's belt?" ([Job 38:31)
- "Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions?" ([Job 38:39)

**God's teaching** emerges not through propositional answers but through overwhelming displays of creation's complexity—weather patterns, celestial bodies, and wild animals all governed by divine wisdom inaccessible to humans.

Job responds humbly: "I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth" ([Job 40:4).

*Second Divine Speech (40:6-41:34):*
**God challenges Job** further: "Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?" ([Job 40:8).

**God describes** two magnificent creatures—Behemoth ([Job 40:15-24) and Leviathan ([Job 41:1-34)—creatures of such power that only God can master them. Regarding Leviathan, **God declares**: "Everything under heaven belongs to me" ([Job 41:11).

**The Epilogue ([Job 42:7-17):**

Job responds with profound repentance: "My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes" ([Job 42:5-6). Job's repentance concerns not moral sin but his presumption in demanding answers from God.

**God then speaks** concerning the three friends: "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has" ([Job 42:7). This divine verdict is crucial—God vindicates Job's protests over the friends' pious explanations. **God commands** them to offer sacrifices and instructs: "My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer" ([Job 42:8).

**God restores** Job's fortunes doubly: 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 donkeys. Job fathers seven more sons and three daughters (named Jemimah, Keziah, and Keren-Happuch, noted as the most beautiful women in the land). Job lives another 140 years, seeing four generations of descendants, and dies "old and full of years" ([Job 42:17).

## Unique Teachings

The Book of Job contains several theological and philosophical teachings that are either unique or receive their most profound treatment here:

**1. Disinterested Righteousness:**
Job introduces the concept that humans can serve God purely for God's sake, not merely for reward. The Satan's question—"Does Job fear God for nothing?" ([Job 1:9)—and Job's faithful response establish the possibility of genuine, disinterested piety. This concept appears nowhere else in Scripture with such clarity.

**2. Suffering Without Sin:**
While other biblical texts acknowledge that suffering doesn't always result from personal sin, Job provides the most sustained exploration of innocent suffering. The narrative explicitly states Job's blamelessness multiple times, demolishing simple retribution theology.

**3. Divine Speeches Without Explanation:**
Uniquely, God appears directly but refuses to explain suffering or defend His justice. Instead, God overwhelms Job with questions about creation, establishing divine prerogative and human limitation. This non-answer becomes itself a profound theological statement: God's wisdom transcends human categories of justice.

**4. The Inaccessibility of Wisdom:**
Chapter 28's magnificent poem on wisdom's hiddenness—"Where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?" ([Job 28:12)—uniquely emphasizes that ultimate wisdom belongs to God alone and cannot be purchased, discovered, or earned by humans.

**5. Resurrection Hope:**
Job 19:25-27 contains the Hebrew Bible's clearest pre-exilic expression of hope for post-mortem vindication and possibly bodily resurrection. While later texts develop this doctrine more fully, Job's statement stands remarkably early and isolated.

**6. Satan as Divine Prosecutor:**
The prologue presents "the Satan" (with the definite article, indicating a role rather than a proper name) as a member of the heavenly court who questions human motives. This early portrayal differs from later developed angelology and demonology.

**7. The Inadequacy of Conventional Wisdom:**
Job radically critiques the wisdom tradition's confident assertions about divine justice and human behavior. While Proverbs confidently declares "the righteous will thrive," Job systematically demonstrates this isn't always true, creating tension within the wisdom corpus itself.

**8. Behemoth and Leviathan:**
These creatures (chapters 40-41) represent chaos powers that God alone can master, unique in biblical literature for their detailed portrayal and theological significance regarding divine sovereignty over creation's dangerous forces.

**9. Blessing the Divine Name in Calamity:**
Job's response—"The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised" ([Job 1:21)—models a form of radical trust in divine sovereignty that accepts both blessing and calamity as from God's hand without bitterness.

**10. The Value of Protest:**
Uniquely among biblical books, Job validates vigorous protest and complaint to God as legitimate piety. God ultimately vindicates Job's protests over his friends' pious platitudes, establishing that honest struggle with God surpasses false comfort.

## Textual Variants

**1. Septuagint (LXX) Length Difference:**

The most significant textual variant is that the Septuagint is approximately **400 lines (one-sixth) shorter** than the Masoretic Hebrew text. For nearly a century, scholars believed the Greek translator used a different Hebrew source. However, detailed analysis revealed the translator employed a "functional equivalence" approach, simplifying Oriental poetic style for Hellenistic readers by removing repetitive phrases and condensing lengthy speeches.

**Significance:** This affects interpretation significantly. Readers using LXX-based translations encounter a more streamlined Job with less elaborate speeches, potentially missing some of the original's rhetorical power and poetic complexity.

**2. Job 2:9 - Wife's Extended Speech:**

The Septuagint includes additional words from Job's wife not found in the Masoretic text. After "Curse God and die," the LXX adds a longer speech describing Job's degradation and her suffering.

**Scholarly assessment:** This expansion may represent original text lost from the Hebrew, or alternatively, an imaginative addition by a Hellenistic scribe seeking to develop her character. Most scholars consider it secondary.

**3. Job 42:17 - Epilogue Gloss:**

The Septuagint concludes with additional material after Job 42:17, stating that Job will be raised again with those whom the Lord raises, and identifying Job with Jobab from Genesis 36.

**Scholarly consensus:** This represents a clear scholastic footnote never intended as scripture, likely added to harmonize Job's story with Genesis genealogies.

**4. Chapter 28 - Wisdom Poem:**

Some scholars question whether chapter 28's magnificent wisdom poem originally belonged to Job or represents a later insertion. It interrupts the dialogue flow and uses different vocabulary.

**Significance:** If secondary, it may have been added to provide theological commentary on the preceding debates. If original, it represents the book's theological center.

**5. Elihu Speeches (Chapters 32-37):**

The Elihu speeches show different vocabulary, style, and theological perspective from the rest of Job. Neither God nor Job acknowledge Elihu's contributions.

**Scholarly consensus:** Most scholars view these chapters as a later addition by a different author who found the original ending unsatisfying. This represents a major compositional variant, though not a manuscript variant per se.

**6. Job 22:21 - Significant Translation Differences:**

The Hebrew and Greek versions of Job 22:21 differ substantially, with the LXX reading quite differently from the Masoretic text, suggesting either variant Hebrew sources or interpretive translation.

## Textual Errors

**1. Corruption in Difficult Passages:**

Scholars widely acknowledge that Job's text is "corrupt" in places, creating numerous text-critical and translation problems. The book contains more textual difficulties than most biblical books, evidenced by the frequency of marginal notes and alternate readings in critical editions.

**Examples:**
- Multiple verses where the Hebrew is grammatically problematic or semantically unclear
- Rare vocabulary appearing nowhere else in biblical Hebrew
- Possible miscopied consonants in the unvocalized text

**Explanation:** Job's linguistic complexity, use of archaic forms, and poetic density made it particularly susceptible to scribal errors during transmission. Copyists may have struggled to understand passages, leading to errors or "corrections" that created further problems.

**2. Translation Challenges:**

Job is exceptionally difficult to translate due to:
- Numerous hapax legomena (words appearing only once in biblical Hebrew)
- Complex poetic structure
- Possible loan words from other ancient languages
- Obscure references to ancient Near Eastern culture

**Evidence:** The Septuagint translators frequently struggled, sometimes omitting lines they didn't understand or providing interpretive paraphrases rather than literal translations.

**3. Verse Numbering Discrepancies:**

Job 40 shows different verse numbering between the Masoretic text and other traditions, suggesting variations in how the text was divided.

**Explanation:** This reflects different traditions of text division rather than content errors, but indicates the text's transmission complexity.

**4. Chapter 28 Placement:**

Some scholars argue chapter 28's wisdom poem may be misplaced, as it interrupts the dialogue structure and would fit better elsewhere.

**Possible explanation:** If not a later insertion, it may have been accidentally displaced during early manuscript transmission.

## Contradictions

**1. Contradiction with Retribution Theology:**

**Internal tension:** Job fundamentally contradicts the theology expressed in Proverbs, which confidently asserts that the righteous prosper while the wicked suffer. Job's experience and God's verdict validate his protests against this simplistic formula.

**Books contradicted:** Proverbs, Deuteronomy (with its blessings and curses), portions of Psalms.

**Possible explanations:**
- Intentional theological correction: Job may deliberately challenge oversimplified earlier theology
- Different contexts: Proverbs describes general patterns; Job addresses exceptional cases
- Wisdom literature paradox: The wisdom corpus intentionally includes contradictory voices (Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes) to present theological complexity rather than simple answers
- Progressive revelation: Later reflection recognized the limitations of early retribution theology

**2. Prologue vs. Dialogue Contradiction:**

**The problem:** The prologue presents Job as patiently enduring without complaint, while the dialogues show Job vehemently protesting and challenging God.

**Scholarly explanation:**
- **Two-source theory:** Many scholars argue the prose prologue/epilogue (folk tale) and poetic dialogues come from different authors with different theological perspectives. The folk tale endorses patient endurance; the poetry validates passionate protest.
- **Literary unity:** Others argue this represents intentional literary technique—showing Job's patience in the initial shock but his struggle as suffering continues, modeling realistic human response to prolonged suffering.
- **Genre difference:** Prose narrative and poetic dialogue follow different literary conventions and serve different purposes.

**3. God's Characterization:**

**The problem:** In the prologue, God appears to permit Job's suffering based on a wager with Satan, which seems morally problematic. In the divine speeches, God appears as transcendent creator unconcerned with explaining Himself to humans.

**Possible explanations:**
- **Literary framework:** The prologue uses folk tale conventions (heavenly court, wager) not meant as literal theology but as narrative framing for the philosophical exploration
- **Multiple perspectives:** The book intentionally presents different theological perspectives without harmonizing them
- **Irony:** The prologue may employ irony—readers know Job's suffering isn't punishment, but the characters don't, creating dramatic tension

**4. Job's Knowledge vs. Ignorance:**

**The problem:** Job sometimes claims to know nothing about God's ways, yet at other points makes confident theological assertions about divine justice and his own righteousness.

**Explanation:** This reflects Job's psychological and spiritual journey. His statements fluctuate between confidence and despair, certainty and doubt, modeling realistic human struggle rather than systematic theology.

**5. The Friends' Condemnation:**

**The problem:** God condemns the three friends for not speaking rightly about Him ([Job 42:7), yet much of what they say theologically aligns with statements God approves elsewhere in Scripture (divine justice, human sinfulness, God's power).

**Possible explanations:**
- **Application error:** The friends weren't wrong about God's general character but wrongly applied retribution theology to Job's specific situation
- **Pastoral failure:** They prioritized defending their theological system over compassionate support
- **False certainty:** They claimed to know God's reasons with certainty they couldn't possess
- **Missing the point:** They focused on Job's supposed sin rather than God's mysterious freedom and sovereignty

**6. Elihu's Ignored Speeches:**

**The problem:** Elihu delivers four lengthy speeches offering a different perspective, yet neither God nor Job acknowledges him. God doesn't condemn him like the other friends, but doesn't commend him either.

**Explanation:**
- **Later addition:** Most scholars view Elihu's speeches as added by a later author, explaining why they're unintegrated into the narrative
- **Literary technique:** The silence may indicate Elihu's contribution adds nothing significant—he's simply ignored
- **Ambiguous evaluation:** The author may leave readers to evaluate Elihu's arguments themselves

**7. Restoration Ending:**

**The problem:** After chapters of exploring suffering's mystery and God's refusal to provide neat answers, the book ends with complete restoration—seemingly returning to the simple retribution theology Job spent the book challenging.

**Possible explanations:**
- **Folk tale frame:** The prose ending returns to the original folk tale genre, which requires happy resolution
- **Different message:** The restoration doesn't validate retribution theology but demonstrates God's graciousness beyond justice
- **Temporal perspective:** The ending suggests ultimate (if not immediate) divine justice, without endorsing the friends' simplistic formula
- **Incomplete restoration:** Job receives new children, but the original children remain dead—loss persists despite restoration

**8. Satan's Role and Theological Development:**

**The problem:** Job's "Satan" (a heavenly prosecutor) differs significantly from later developed Christian demonology, creating apparent contradictions with New Testament theology.

**Explanation:**
- **Progressive revelation:** Jewish and Christian theology developed significantly between Job's composition and later texts
- **Different concept:** Job's "satan" (with article) denotes a role, not the personal evil being of later theology
- **Literary device:** The heavenly court may serve narrative purposes rather than systematic angelology
