# Isaiah

## Authorship

The authorship of the Book of Isaiah is a central debate in biblical scholarship. The traditional view attributes the entire book to [Isaiah ben Amoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah), an 8th-century BCE prophet. This view is supported by early Jewish and Christian tradition and the book's internal references (Isaiah 1:1). Defenders cite the consistency of the phrase 'the Holy One of Israel' throughout the book and the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) as evidence for unity and the possibility of predictive prophecy.

However, the dominant view in modern critical scholarship posits multiple authorship, dividing the book into three sections:
- **Proto-Isaiah (Isaiah 1-39):** Attributed to the historical Isaiah of the 8th century BCE.
- **Deutero-Isaiah (Isaiah 40-55):** Attributed to an anonymous prophet during the Babylonian exile (550-539 BCE), evidenced by direct references to exile and King [Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great).
- **Trito-Isaiah (Isaiah 56-66):** Attributed to another author (or authors) writing post-exile (after 538 BCE).

This three-part division, systematized by [Bernhard Duhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Duhm), reflects different historical contexts, theological emphases, and literary styles. While acknowledging this complexity, recent scholarship also emphasizes the book's literary unity through redactional processes. The debate highlights differing views on prophecy and scriptural formation.

## Historical Environment

The Book of Isaiah spans multiple historical periods. Proto-Isaiah (Isaiah 1-39) is set in 8th-century BCE Jerusalem, where the prophet Isaiah ben Amoz confronts the rising threat of the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire) and warns Judah's kings against foreign alliances. Deutero-Isaiah (Isaiah 40-55) addresses the 6th-century BCE Babylonian exile, offering comfort and hope centered on [Cyrus the Great's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) impending conquest of Babylon. Trito-Isaiah (Isaiah 56-66) reflects the post-exilic period (after 538 BCE), dealing with the disappointment and social tensions of the small, vulnerable community in Persian-ruled Judah.

**Literary Coherence:** Despite these distinct historical settings, Isaiah demonstrates remarkable thematic and literary unity. Sequential reading reveals deliberate progression: judgment passages flow into restoration promises, creating alternating patterns that demonstrate theological coherence. For example, Isaiah 8 (naming the child Maher-shalal-hash-baz, "swift to plunder") presents judgment, immediately followed by Isaiah 9 (the child with royal titles) presenting hope. This literary structure suggests careful composition, whether by a single prophet addressing multiple eras through divine revelation or by successive prophets working within a unified theological tradition. Across these distinct contexts, the book maintains consistent focus on God's sovereignty over history, His judgment of sin, and His ultimate plan for restoration.

## Purpose

The Book of Isaiah served multiple purposes across its compositional history, addressing different communities in different historical crises while maintaining a unified theological vision.

### Proto-Isaiah (Isaiah 1-39)

Writing to 8th-century Judah facing Assyrian threat, Isaiah's primary purpose was to **call his people back to covenant faithfulness and social justice**. He condemned ritual worship divorced from righteousness, specifically targeting exploitation of the poor, corrupt courts, and abuse of power (Isaiah 1:10-23, 5:8-23). Yet Isaiah also warned of coming judgment if Judah persisted in rebellion (Isaiah 5:1-7), while counseling trust in God rather than foreign political alliances (Isaiah 7:9, 30-31). Even amid judgment, Isaiah preserved hope, envisioning a faithful remnant, a future righteous king, and a time when all nations would stream to Jerusalem to learn God's ways (Isaiah 9-11, 2:2-4). The oracles against foreign nations demonstrated God's sovereignty over all peoples (Isaiah 13-23).

### Deutero-Isaiah (Isaiah 40-55)

**Addressed to exiles traumatized by Babylon's destruction** of Jerusalem, this section opens with comfort: "Comfort, comfort my people" (Isaiah 40:1-2). Deutero-Isaiah proclaims imminent liberation through Cyrus of Persia (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1), portraying it as a new exodus. The section asserts radical monotheism—"I am the Lord, and there is no other" (Isaiah 45:5)—while mocking Babylonian idols. Through the Servant Songs, Israel's mission is redefined as bringing light and justice to the nations (Isaiah 42:1-9, 49:1-6), with suffering itself becoming redemptive (Isaiah 52:13-53:12). Throughout, God affirms His unbreakable covenant with Israel (Isaiah 49:15).

### Trito-Isaiah (Isaiah 56-66)

For post-exilic returnees facing disappointing circumstances, this section **addresses practical community questions**: Who belongs to God's people? Surprisingly inclusive answers welcome foreigners and eunuchs (Isaiah 56:3-8). Trito-Isaiah calls for genuine justice (Isaiah 58:6-7), maintains hope despite present disappointment (Isaiah 60:1), and emphasizes that God desires contrite hearts over temple buildings (Isaiah 66:1). The section culminates in visions of new heavens and new earth (Isaiah 65:17-18).

### Overarching Purpose

Across all three sections, Isaiah pursues a unified purpose: **asserting God's holiness, sovereignty, and commitment to justice** while calling His people to faithful response through trust, righteousness, and worship.

## Cross-References

Isaiah is one of the most quoted and referenced books in the entire Bible. Its influence on later biblical literature, especially the New Testament, is profound and extensive. Understanding these cross-references illuminates both Isaiah's original message and how later writers interpreted and applied it.

### Isaiah in the New Testament

Isaiah is quoted or alluded to more than any other prophetic book in the New Testament. According to various counts, Isaiah is directly quoted or clearly referenced approximately 21 times in the Gospels and 25 times in Paul's letters. Remarkably, all but 25 of the New Testament's 260 chapters quote from or allude to Isaiah directly or indirectly.

**Gospels**

The Gospels frequently cite Isaiah to demonstrate Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy:

- **Matthew 1:22-23** quotes Isaiah 7:14 regarding the virgin birth: "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son"
- **Matthew 3:3** (also Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4-6, John 1:23) quotes Isaiah 40:3 about John the Baptist preparing the way
- **Matthew 4:14-16** quotes Isaiah 9:1-2 about light dawning in Galilee

- **John 12:38** quotes Isaiah 53:1: "Lord, who has believed our message?"

**Paul's Letters**

Paul draws extensively on Isaiah, particularly for themes of salvation, God's righteousness, and inclusion of the Gentiles:

- **Romans 9:27-29** quotes Isaiah 10:22-23 and Isaiah 1:9 about the remnant
- **Romans 10:16** quotes Isaiah 53:1 about belief
- **Romans 10:20-21** quotes Isaiah 65:1-2 about God being found by those who didn't seek Him (Gentiles)
- **Romans 11:8** alludes to Isaiah 29:10 about spiritual blindness
- **Romans 15:12** quotes Isaiah 11:10 about the root of Jesse and Gentiles hoping in Him
- **Romans 15:21** quotes Isaiah 52:15 about those who have never been told

### The Suffering Servant in the New Testament

The Suffering Servant passages, especially Isaiah 52:13-53:12, are among the most important Old Testament texts for Christian interpretation. The New Testament explicitly applies these passages to Jesus at least seven times:

1. **Matthew 8:17** - Jesus' healing ministry
2. **Mark 15:28** - Jesus numbered with transgressors (textual variant)
3. **Luke 22:37** - Jesus counted among transgressors
4. **John 12:38** - Belief in Jesus
5. **Acts 8:32-35** - Philip explains Isaiah 53 to the Ethiopian eunuch
6. **Romans 10:16** - Unbelief in the gospel message
7. **1 Peter 2:22-25** - Christ's suffering and atonement

### Isaiah's Influence on Other Old Testament Books

Within the Old Testament itself, later prophets and writers drew on Isaianic themes and language:

- **Jeremiah** echoes Isaiah's themes of judgment and hope
- **Ezekiel** shares Isaiah's vision of God's glory and holiness
- **The Book of Daniel** reflects Isaiah's apocalyptic imagery
- **Zechariah** draws on Isaiah's vision of restoration and messianic hope
- **The Psalms** occasionally reflect Isaianic language and themes

### Quantitative Significance

Isaiah's prominence in the New Testament is remarkable:
- **Romans** contains 48 Old Testament quotes, making it one of the most quote-heavy books in the New Testament
- **Hebrews** has 41 Old Testament quotes
- **Matthew** has 35 Old Testament quotes, with Isaiah being among the most frequently cited sources

The Gospel of Matthew particularly emphasizes fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecies, using the formula "This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah" multiple times throughout the narrative.

## Canonical Status

Isaiah has enjoyed undisputed canonical status in both Jewish and Christian traditions. In the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), Isaiah is part of the Latter Prophets (Nevi'im Aḥaronim), canonized around 200 BCE. Early evidence appears in Ben Sira (c. 196-175 BCE) and the Dead Sea Scrolls: the Great Isaiah Scroll (c. 125 BCE) is the oldest complete biblical manuscript, and Qumran contained at least 22 Isaiah copies—more than any prophetic book except Psalms and Deuteronomy.

Christians inherited Isaiah as authoritative scripture. Early church fathers universally accepted it, and every ancient canon list and council—from the Muratorian Canon (c. 170 CE) to the Council of Trent (1546 CE)—included Isaiah. Remarkably, Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions all agree on its canonical status.

Isaiah achieved this undisputed recognition through multiple factors: clear prophetic identity, theological orthodoxy, historical significance, textual stability, and continuous liturgical use.

## Summary

The Book of Isaiah is a prophetic masterwork spanning 66 chapters, presenting God's message of judgment, hope, and ultimate restoration. This summary covers the entire book with particular attention to God's direct speech and divine teachings.

### Judgment and Hope (Isaiah 1-39)

#### The Opening Indictment (Isaiah 1-6)

Isaiah opens with God's own words of accusation against His people: "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken: 'Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me'" (Isaiah 1:2). God condemns their empty religious rituals while they oppress the vulnerable. Through Isaiah, God commands: "Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause" (Isaiah 1:16-17).

God offers a striking promise: "Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool" (Isaiah 1:18). Yet judgment is coming for those who persist in rebellion.

Isaiah 2:2-4 presents a magnificent vision of the future: "It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains... and all the nations shall flow to it." God declares that nations will learn His ways and "He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks" (Isaiah 2:4).

Isaiah 3-5 continue God's indictment. The Lord "will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: 'It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses. What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?'" (Isaiah 3:14-15). The Song of the Vineyard (Isaiah 5:1-7) depicts God's disappointment: "He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, an outcry!" (Isaiah 5:7).

Isaiah 6 records Isaiah's profound vision of God's holiness. Isaiah sees "the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up" (Isaiah 6:1). Seraphim cry out: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" (Isaiah 6:3). God commissions Isaiah with a difficult message: the people will hear but not understand, see but not perceive (Isaiah 6:9-10), yet "a holy seed" will remain (Isaiah 6:13).

#### The Book of Immanuel (Isaiah 7-12)

During the Syro-Ephraimite crisis, God sends Isaiah to King Ahaz with the message: "Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint" (Isaiah 7:4). God offers Ahaz a sign, and when he refuses, God declares: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14).

God speaks directly in Isaiah 8:11-15, warning not to fear what others fear but to regard the Lord as holy: "The Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" (Isaiah 8:13).

Isaiah 9:1-7 contains the famous messianic prophecy: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). God promises: "Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom" (Isaiah 9:7).

Isaiah 10 pronounces woes on unjust legislators: "Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression" (Isaiah 10:1). God reveals that Assyria is His instrument: "Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury!" (Isaiah 10:5). Yet Assyria's arrogance will also be judged (Isaiah 10:12-19).

Isaiah 11:1-9 envisions a righteous king from David's line: "There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him" (Isaiah 11:1-2). This ruler will judge with righteousness: "He shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked" (Isaiah 11:4). In that day, "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb... for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea" (Isaiah 11:6-9).

#### Oracles Against the Nations (Isaiah 13-23)

God pronounces judgment on the nations, demonstrating His sovereignty over all peoples. Against Babylon, God declares: "Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them" (Isaiah 13:17). God will "punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity" (Isaiah 13:11).

Isaiah 14 contains a taunt against Babylon's king, including the famous passage often interpreted as referring to Satan's fall: "How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!" (Isaiah 14:12). God declares: "This is the purpose that is purposed concerning the whole earth... For the Lord of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it?" (Isaiah 14:26-27).

Similar oracles follow against Moab (Isaiah 15-16), Damascus (Isaiah 17), Ethiopia (Isaiah 18), Egypt (Isaiah 19-20), and Tyre (Isaiah 23). Through these judgments, God demonstrates that He alone controls the destiny of nations.

#### Isaiah's Apocalypse (Isaiah 24-27)

These chapters present cosmic judgment and ultimate restoration. God will "empty the earth and make it desolate" (Isaiah 24:1), but He promises: "On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food" (Isaiah 25:6). Most remarkably, God declares: "He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces" (Isaiah 25:8).

Isaiah 26 celebrates God as the people's strength: "You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you" (Isaiah 26:3). The chapter ends with a promise of resurrection: "Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise" (Isaiah 26:19).

#### Woes and Promises (Isaiah 28-35)

Isaiah 28 pronounces woe on Ephraim's drunkards and corrupt leaders. God speaks: "I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation" (Isaiah 28:16).

God condemns those who hide their plans from Him (Isaiah 29:15) and those who honor Him with lips while their hearts are far away (Isaiah 29:13).

Isaiah 30-31 warn against trusting Egypt rather than God. God declares: "Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult the Lord!" (Isaiah 31:1).

Isaiah 32-33 promise a righteous king and God's ultimate justice. Isaiah 34-35 contrast judgment on Edom with the glorious restoration of Zion: "The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus" (Isaiah 35:1). God promises: "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then shall the lame man leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute sing for joy" (Isaiah 35:5-6).

#### Historical Interlude: Hezekiah (Isaiah 36-39)

These chapters narrate the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem under Sennacherib. The Assyrian envoy blasphemes God (Isaiah 36:18-20), but Hezekiah prays, and God responds through Isaiah: "I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David" (Isaiah 37:35). That night, God strikes down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers (Isaiah 37:36).

After Hezekiah's illness and healing, he foolishly shows Babylonian envoys his treasures. Isaiah prophesies that everything will be carried to Babylon (Isaiah 39:5-7), setting up the second major section.

### Comfort and Restoration (Isaiah 40-55)

#### The God of Comfort (Isaiah 40)

This section opens with God's command: "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned" (Isaiah 40:1-2). A voice cries: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God" (Isaiah 40:3).

God declares His incomparability: "To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?" (Isaiah 40:18). He sits "above the circle of the earth" (Isaiah 40:22) and gives power to the faint: "They who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint" (Isaiah 40:31).

#### God's Sovereignty and Israel's Calling (Isaiah 41-48)

God challenges the idols and declares His uniqueness: "I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God" (Isaiah 45:5). He announces: "I form light and create darkness, I make well-being and create calamity, I am the Lord, who does all these things" (Isaiah 45:7).

God names Cyrus as His anointed: "Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him" (Isaiah 45:1). God declares: "I have roused him in righteousness, and I will make all his ways level; he shall build my city and set my exiles free" (Isaiah 45:13).

The first Servant Song appears in Isaiah 42:1-9. God speaks: "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations" (Isaiah 42:1).

God mocks the idols: "All who fashion idols are nothing... Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing?" (Isaiah 44:9-10). In contrast, God alone is Creator and Redeemer.

God promises a new exodus: "Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert" (Isaiah 43:18-19).

#### The Servant's Mission (Isaiah 49-55)

The second Servant Song (Isaiah 49:1-6) presents the Servant speaking: "The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name" (Isaiah 49:1). God says to the Servant: "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob... I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth" (Isaiah 49:6).

God affirms His unfailing love: "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:15-16).

The third Servant Song (Isaiah 50:4-9) presents the Servant's obedience: "The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught... Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught. The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious; I turned not backward. I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting" (Isaiah 50:4-6).

God calls His people: "Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem" (Isaiah 52:1). He promises: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, 'Your God reigns'" (Isaiah 52:7).

The fourth and climactic Servant Song (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) presents God's Suffering Servant. God declares: "Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted" (Isaiah 52:13). The passage describes vicarious suffering: "Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows... he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed" (Isaiah 53:4-5). "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6).

Isaiah 54 continues God's promises: "For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you" (Isaiah 54:7). God swears: "This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you" (Isaiah 54:9). God promises His people's children: "All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children" (Isaiah 54:13). This promise of divine teaching was later quoted by Jesus in John 6:45, applying it to those drawn to Him by the Father.

Isaiah 55 contains God's gracious invitation: "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price" (Isaiah 55:1). God promises: "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth... so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it" (Isaiah 55:10-11).

### The Glorious Future (Isaiah 56-66)

#### Inclusion and Justice (Isaiah 56-59)

God declares that foreigners and eunuchs who keep His covenant will be included: "These I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer... for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples" (Isaiah 56:7).

God condemns false worship and defines true fasting: "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house?" (Isaiah 58:6-7).

Isaiah 59 catalogs Israel's sins but promises redemption: "And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, declares the Lord" (Isaiah 59:20).

#### Zion's Glory (Isaiah 60-62)

God proclaims: "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you" (Isaiah 60:1). Nations will come to Jerusalem's light (Isaiah 60:3), and God promises: "I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age" (Isaiah 60:15).

Isaiah 61 opens with the Spirit-anointed herald: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound" (Isaiah 61:1).

God declares His love for Zion: "For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch" (Isaiah 62:1).

#### Judgment and New Creation (Isaiah 63-66)

Isaiah 63 depicts God as divine warrior and remembers His past mercies. The people cry: "O Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our heart, so that we fear you not?" (Isaiah 63:17).

God responds in Isaiah 64-65. He declares: "I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that was not called by my name" (Isaiah 65:1).

God promises new creation: "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness" (Isaiah 65:17-18). In that day, "The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox" (Isaiah 65:25).

The book concludes with God's declaration: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?" (Isaiah 66:1). God looks to "him who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word" (Isaiah 66:2).

God promises: "As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem" (Isaiah 66:13). The book ends with eschatological vision: all flesh will come to worship before God (Isaiah 66:23), and the wicked will face eternal judgment (Isaiah 66:24).

Throughout its 66 chapters, Isaiah presents God's own words with remarkable consistency: He is holy, sovereign, and just, yet also merciful, faithful, and redemptive. The book moves from judgment to comfort to ultimate restoration, always centering on God's character and purposes for His people and all nations.

## Unique Teachings

Isaiah contains several theological and thematic teachings that are either unique to this book or presented with distinctive emphases not found elsewhere in scripture. These unique contributions have profoundly shaped Jewish and Christian theology.

**Note on Messianic Prophecies:** Isaiah contains numerous passages later interpreted as messianic prophecies.

### The Four Titles (Isaiah 9:6)

Related to this messianic hope is Isaiah 9:6's promise: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given... and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." The Hebrew אֵל גִּבּוֹר ('êl gibbôr), traditionally translated "Mighty God," presents linguistic complexity. The term 'êl can mean "God" but also "mighty one" or "divine hero." Martin Luther's German translation rendered this phrase as "divine hero" (Held-Gott), reflecting the semantic range. Scholars debate whether the titles indicate divinity or describe a divinely empowered human king in hyperbolic royal language common in ancient Near Eastern court contexts. The sequential reading from Isaiah 8 (judgment) to Isaiah 9 (restoration) shows thematic progression in Isaiah's message.

The accompanying vision of a transformed creation where "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb" and "they shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea" (Isaiah 11:6-9) presents a unique eschatological hope that influenced Jewish messianic expectations and Christian theology.

## Textual Variants

The textual transmission of Isaiah provides fascinating insights into how ancient scribes preserved and sometimes modified biblical texts. With manuscript evidence spanning over 2,000 years—from the Dead Sea Scrolls (c. 125 BCE) to medieval manuscripts—scholars can examine how the text was transmitted and where significant variants occur.

- [Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/)

### The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaᵃ)

The most important textual witness for Isaiah is the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaᵃ) from Qumran Cave 1, dating to approximately 125 BCE. This is the oldest complete manuscript of any biblical book and predates the standard Masoretic Text by about 1,000 years. The scroll is remarkably similar to the Masoretic Text—approximately 95% identical—demonstrating careful textual preservation.

However, the Great Isaiah Scroll contains over 2,600 variants compared to the Masoretic Text. Most of these are minor: spelling differences, use of matres lectionis (vowel letters), grammatical variations, and stylistic changes. For example, 1QIsaᵃ typically uses fuller spelling with more vowel letters (כיא instead of כי in Isaiah 1:2).

### Major Textual Variants Between Dead Sea Scrolls and Masoretic Text

#### "Turn away from man" verse missing (Isaiah 2:22)

The Masoretic Text includes: "Turn away from man, in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?" **This entire verse is absent from the Septuagint and some Dead Sea Scrolls manuscripts.**

Some suggest it may have been a marginal note that entered some textual traditions.

#### "Lion" vs "seer" (Isaiah 21:8)

**MT reads "a lion" (אַרְיֵה, aryeh) while 1QIsaᵃ reads "the seer" (הָרֹאֶה, haro'eh).** This affects the meaning: MT has "Then he who saw cried out: 'Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed whole nights. And behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!' And he answered, 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon.'" The 1QIsaᵃ reading "the seer" makes better contextual sense, as it clearly identifies the watchman as a seer/prophet.

#### Difficult Hebrew word in Suffering Servant passage (Isaiah 52:14)

MT reads "I anointed/marred" (מִשְׁחַת, mishchat) referring to the servant's appearance being so marred. **This word has caused interpretive difficulties, and some manuscripts show variant readings attempting to clarify the difficult Hebrew.**

The theological significance is profound: **the servant's appearance is disfigured "beyond human semblance"** (Isaiah 52:14), creating a radical paradox where exaltation comes through extreme humiliation. This challenges ancient assumptions that suffering indicates divine curse, instead presenting the most marred person as God's chosen instrument for redemption. The disfigurement represents **vicarious suffering that accomplishes salvation for others** (Isaiah 53:4-6: "by his wounds we are healed"). Christian interpretation applies this to Christ's crucifixion, while Jewish interpretation sees it as Israel's redemptive suffering among the nations.

#### Missing word "light" in Suffering Servant passage (Isaiah 53:11)

One of the most significant textual variants: MT reads "From the travail of his soul he shall see and be satisfied." The verb "see" lacks an object. However, **1QIsaᵃ adds "light"** (אור, or): "Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see light." The LXX also supports reading "light," suggesting this may have been the original text. Many modern translations include "light" based on this evidence.

### Variants Between Masoretic Text and Septuagint

The Septuagint (LXX), the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible (c. 200-100 BCE), sometimes preserves readings that differ from the Masoretic Text, suggesting it was translated from a different Hebrew textual tradition.

#### "Young woman" translated as "virgin" in LXX (Isaiah 7:14)

The famous messianic prophecy shows a significant translation choice: **the Hebrew עַלְמָה (almah, "young woman") was translated in the LXX as παρθένος (parthenos, "virgin").** While almah can refer to a virgin in Hebrew, it doesn't necessarily mean virgin. **The LXX translator chose the more specific Greek term, which Matthew 1:23 quotes when applying this prophecy to Jesus' virgin birth.**

This isn't strictly a textual variant (the Hebrew is the same), but it represents an early interpretive translation that profoundly influenced Christian reading of the text.

#### Different punctuation affects meaning of "in the wilderness" (Isaiah 40:3)

MT punctuates: 

> A voice cries: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'

The LXX (and the New Testament quotations) punctuate differently: 

> A voice crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord.'

This affects whether "in the wilderness" describes **where the voice cries or where the way should be prepared**.

Both are valid Hebrew readings, showing how ancient texts without punctuation marks could be read different ways.

#### "Plucking the beard" vs "strikes to the cheeks" (Isaiah 50:6)

A significant textual difference exists in the third Servant Song regarding what happens to the servant's cheeks:

- **MT (Hebrew):** "my cheeks to those who pluck out the beard" (מָרַט *māraṭ* - meaning "to pluck, to pull out hair/beard") - [Isaiah 50:6 Hebrew Interlinear](https://www.studylight.org/interlinear-study-bible/hebrew/isaiah/50-6.html)
- **LXX (Greek):** "my cheeks to blows/strikes" (ῥάπισμα *rhapisma* - meaning "a slap, a blow with the palm of the hand") - [Isaiah 50:6 Greek Interlinear](https://www.studylight.org/interlinear-study-bible/greek/isaiah/50-6.html)

The LXX does **not** mention "beard" or "hair" at all—only being struck on the cheeks. This represents either a different Hebrew Vorlage (underlying text) that the LXX translators worked from, or an interpretive translation choice.

**Prophetic fulfillment:** The Gospels record Jesus being struck and slapped on the face (Matthew 26:67; Mark 14:65; John 18:22), which aligns precisely with the LXX reading. The Gospels make **no mention** of Jesus' beard being plucked out, suggesting the LXX preserves the correct reading of this messianic prophecy.

### Variants in Multiple Dead Sea Scrolls Manuscripts

At least 22 copies of Isaiah were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, showing different textual traditions.

#### Verses in different order or absent from some manuscripts (Isaiah 38:21-22)

These verses about **Hezekiah's healing appear in a different order** in some manuscripts and are **completely absent from some LXX witnesses,** raising questions about their original placement or whether they were added later.

## Textual Errors

Like all ancient texts, Isaiah contains passages where scholars have identified possible textual corruptions, copying errors, or difficulties that suggest problems in transmission. This section examines these issues from both critical and conservative scholarly perspectives.

- [A Scientific Analysis of Isaiah Authorship (BYU Religious Studies Center)](https://rsc.byu.edu/isaiah-prophets/scientific-analysis-isaiah-authorship)

### Chronological Issues in Isaiah's Ministry (Isaiah 1:1, 6:1)

Isaiah 1:1 states Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. However, Isaiah 6:1 describes Isaiah's call vision "in the year that King Uzziah died." If Isaiah 6 records Isaiah's prophetic commission, Isaiah 1-5 would predate his call, which seems **chronologically impossible**.

#### Scholarly Explanations
- The book may not be arranged chronologically; Isaiah 6 could be positioned for theological/literary reasons rather than chronological sequence
- Isaiah may have been active as a prophet before his formal temple vision commission
- Isaiah 1-5 may have been placed as a thematic introduction composed later in Isaiah's career
- The superscription in 1:1 may have been added by later editors and reflects the overall span of traditions in the book rather than Isaiah's personal ministry dates

Isaiah may have had preliminary prophetic activity before his dramatic temple vision, or the book's arrangement reflects thematic rather than strict chronological organization, which is common in prophetic literature.

​Chapter 6 is placed afterwards not to tell you when Isaiah started, but to substantiate his authority to preach the harsh message found in chapters 1–5.

### Mathematical/Numerical Issues (Isaiah 7:8)

Isaiah 7:8 states: "Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered from being a people." However, Ephraim (Northern Kingdom of Israel) was conquered and exiled by Assyria in 722 BCE, only about 10-13 years after this prophecy (given around 735-732 BCE during the Syro-Ephraimite War), not 65 years.

#### Scholarly Explanations
- The prophecy may refer to complete ethnic dissolution (assimilation) rather than mere conquest, which took longer
- The timeframe might count from a different starting point than modern scholars assume
- Later Assyrian deportations (e.g., under Esarhaddon c. 670 BCE) may complete the fulfillment

### Geographical Confusion (Isaiah 13:17, 21:2)

Isaiah 13:17 prophesies **Media will destroy Babylon, but historically, Cyrus the Persian (with Median support) conquered Babylon**. Isaiah 21:2 mentions "Elam" and "Media" attacking, but the Persians (closely related to Elamites) were the primary conquerors.

#### Scholarly Explanations
- The Medes and Persians were closely allied, and "Media" could represent the broader coalition
- Ancient sources sometimes used "Media" and "Persia" somewhat interchangeably in referring to the Medo-Persian Empire
- The prophecy correctly identifies the general region and ethnic groups involved in Babylon's fall
- Prophetic literature often uses broader geographical/ethnic categories rather than precise political designations

### Judgment and Restoration of Tyre (Isaiah 23)

Isaiah 23 contains a prophecy about the wealthy Phoenician port city of Tyre being destroyed. But here's the problem: **what the prophecy predicted didn't happen the way it was written**.

> Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for **Tyre is laid waste**, without house or harbor! — Isaiah 23:1 (ESV)

That's the original prophecy. But then, several verses later, the text adds:

> **Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years**... At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and **she will return to her wages** and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world. — Isaiah 23:15-17 (ESV)

Historical evidence shows that Tyre was **not** abandoned for 70 years:

What Actually Happened:
- Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon besieged Tyre (586-573 BCE) but [failed to capture the island city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(586–573_BC))
- The Bible itself admits this in Ezekiel 29:18: "he and his army got no reward from Tyre"
- Tyre experienced only about 36-40 years of diminished status under Babylonian control (573-539 BCE)
- The city was **never abandoned**—it remained continuously inhabited
- [Alexander the Great conquered Tyre](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/107/alexanders-siege-of-tyre-332-bce/) in 332 BCE, but the city was rebuilt and thrived for centuries
- [Tyre still exists today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon) as Sur, Lebanon

#### Evidence the "70 Years" Was Added Later

Scholars have discovered evidence that verses 15-18 (the part about "70 years forgotten" and restoration) were **written by different authors at a later time**, possibly to explain why the original prophecy didn't come true as expected.

The Evidence:

1. **Different Historical Periods**: [Mark Leuchter's scholarly study](https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-87-2006/tyre-s-70-years-in-isaiah-23-15-18/115/) (published in the academic journal *Biblica*, 2006) demonstrates that verses 15-18 were written during King Josiah's reign (late 7th century BCE), **over 100 years after Isaiah lived**

2. **Different Theological Language**: The "70 years" section uses [Mesopotamian theological concepts](https://readingreligion.org/9780198816768/a-redactional-study-of-the-book-of-isaiah-13-23/) from Esarhaddon's era that weren't part of Isaiah's 8th-century vocabulary

3. **Literary Layers**: [Jongkyung Lee's redaction study](https://academic.oup.com/book/6793) (*A Redactional Study of the Book of Isaiah 13-23*, Oxford University Press, 2018) identifies multiple editorial additions throughout Isaiah 13-23, including verses 15-18 in chapter 23

4. **The "70 Years" Formula**: This specific time period appears in other biblical texts (Jeremiah) as a [symbolic number for a complete period of judgment](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/47781/isaiahs-prophecy-of-70-years-of-tyre), not a literal timeline

5. **Dead Sea Scrolls Confirmation**: The [Great Isaiah Scroll](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/the-great-isaiah-scroll-1qisaa-catalogue-of-textual-variants/) (~125 BCE) contains these verses, confirming they were added by 125 BCE but not proving they were original to Isaiah's 8th-century ministry

What This Means:

Later editors—likely prophetic scribes during the 7th or 6th century BCE—saw that Tyre wasn't permanently destroyed as verse 1 seemed to predict. They probably added verses 15-18 to reinterpret the prophecy: "Yes, Tyre will experience judgment, but it's temporary (70 years), then restoration." This was a **normal practice in ancient times**—not fraud or deceive, but how prophetic communities updated and reapplied earlier oracles to new situations.

#### How Scholars Explain This

##### Critical Academic View

[Mainstream biblical scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaticinium_ex_eventu) views this as an example of how ancient communities handled [failed prophecies](https://www.pthu.nl/en/bibleblog/2024/10/when-prophecy-doesnt-come-true/):

- The original oracle (verses 1-14) predicted Tyre's destruction during the Assyrian period (8th century BCE)
- When this didn't happen as expected, later editors added verses 15-18 to reinterpret it
- This is called ["prophecy after the event"](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/53962/were-the-prophesies-in-isaiah-and-ezekiel-about-tyre-actually-fulfilled)—writing as if predicting, but actually reflecting known history
- Scholar [Robert P. Carroll documented](https://www.amazon.com/When-prophecy-failed-reactions-traditions/dp/0334017890) how biblical communities rationalized unfulfilled prophecies through creative reinterpretation

##### Conservative Evangelical View

Scholars like [John N. Oswalt](https://www.eerdmans.com/Products/0802825281/the-book-of-isaiah-chapters-139.aspx) and [Gleason Archer](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Bible-Difficulties-Gleason-Archer/dp/0310431670) defend the prophecy as genuinely predictive:

- The "70 years" is symbolic, representing Babylon's empire period (606-539 BCE), not literal abandonment
- "Forgotten" means loss of commercial prominence, not physical destruction
- God's prophecies can be conditional—if Tyre responded differently, outcomes could change (see [Jeremiah 18:7-10 principle](https://www.perspectivedigest.org/archive/27-2/why-were-some-of-the-prophecies-not-fulfilled))
- The prophecy was fulfilled "in principle"—Tyre did decline and recover

Some scholars like [Kris J. Udd](https://www.tyndalebulletin.org/article/29192-prediction-and-foreknowledge-in-ezekiel-s-prophecy-against-tyre.pdf) (Tyndale Bulletin, 2005) acknowledge the prophecy wasn't literally fulfilled but suggest "relational omniscience"—God knew multiple possible futures and adapted the plan based on human choices.

## Contradictions

Isaiah, like many biblical books, contains passages that appear to contradict each other or conflict with other biblical texts. This section examines these apparent contradictions and provides scholarly explanations from both critical and conservative perspectives.

### The Death of King Ahaz (Isaiah 14:28-32 cf. 2 Kings 16)

Isaiah 14:28-32 begins with a time marker: "In the year that King Ahaz died." Readers naturally expect this dating formula to connect the prophecy to Ahaz's death—that is, the prophecy should address events *caused by or directly related to* Ahaz's death. However, the oracle that follows is directed entirely at Philistia and makes no explicit mention of Ahaz or how his death relates to the Philistine situation. This creates an interpretive ambiguity: **Why is a prophecy against Philistia dated to Ahaz's death if the content doesn't explicitly explain the connection?**

#### Explanations
- The prophecy indirectly relates to Ahaz's death: Philistia apparently celebrated when Ahaz died, hoping his death would weaken Judah and create an opportunity for them. Isaiah's oracle addresses this premature celebration and warns them of their miscalculation.
- The dating formula serves to mark the historical occasion when the prophecy was delivered, even if the connection between the event and the oracle's content is implicit rather than explicit.
- Historical records may be incomplete. Ancient Near Eastern diplomatic histories weren't always thoroughly documented, so we lack the full political context that would make the connection obvious to original readers.

### God's Changeability (Isaiah 31:2 cf. Isaiah 38:1-5)

Isaiah presents **God as both unchangeable** (Isaiah 31:2: "he does not call back his words") and as **the God Who changes His mind**. In Isaiah 38:1-5, God tells Hezekiah through Isaiah, "Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover." But after Hezekiah prays, God sends Isaiah back: "I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life" (Isaiah 38:5).

#### Explanations

- **Conservative View:** God's character is unchanging, but His specific actions respond to human repentance and prayer. Conditional prophecies depend on human response (see Jeremiah 18:7-10). God's "change" reflects covenant relationship, not character instability.
- **Critical View:** Different authors or traditions had different understandings of God's nature. Some emphasized divine sovereignty and unchangeability, others emphasized divine responsiveness to prayer.
- **Theological Synthesis:** God's essential nature (holiness, love, justice) doesn't change, but His relational responses to human beings are dynamic. A good parent doesn't change in character but adjusts responses based on the child's behavior.

### God Creating Evil (Isaiah 45:7 vs. Other Texts)

> I form light and create darkness;  
> I make well-being and create calamity;  
> I am the LORD, who does all these things.
> — Isaiah 45:7 (ESV)

This seems to contradict passages that attribute evil to Satan or human free will (e.g., James 1:13: "God... tempts no one").

#### Explanations
- **Different Meanings of "Evil":** The Hebrew word רָע (ra) in Isaiah 45:7 means "calamity," "disaster," or "hardship" and not moral evil. God creates circumstances of judgment and disaster as **responses to sin**, not moral evil itself.
- **Monotheistic Polemic:** Against Babylonian dualism (which had separate gods for good and evil), Isaiah asserts Yahweh's sovereignty over all circumstances, both blessing and calamity.
- **Theological Distinction:** God is sovereign over all events (including using calamity for judgment) without being the author of moral evil. He permits evil and uses it for His purposes without originating it.

### The Suffering Servant's Identity (Isaiah 49:3 cf. Isaiah 49:5-6)

Isaiah identifies the servant as Israel (Isaiah 49:3: "You are My servant, Israel") but also describes the servant's mission as restoring Israel (Isaiah 49:5-6: "to bring Jacob back to him that Israel might be gathered to him"). This creates an apparent contradiction: **Is the servant Israel, or does the servant have a mission to Israel?**

[Barnes' Notes states](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/49.htm):

> There is no variety in the ancient versions, or in the MSS.

**All manuscript witnesses (Masoretic Text, Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls) unanimously include "Israel."** The scholarly conjecture is based on logical difficulty, not textual evidence. See H.M. Orlinsky, "'Israel' in Isa. XLIX, 3" (1967) for academic discussion.

#### Explanations
- **Corporate and Individual:** The servant represents both the nation (corporately) and an ideal individual (possibly the future messiah). Ancient texts often moved fluidly between corporate and individual identities.
- **Israel and Israel's Representative:** The servant is Israel's ideal representative—what Israel was called to be but failed to achieve. This representative Israelite accomplishes Israel's mission.
- **Multiple Referents:** Different servant passages may refer to different figures—some to Israel, others to a specific individual.

Christians see progressive revelation culminating in Christ as the ultimate Servant, Israel's representative who accomplishes what corporate Israel couldn't.

### God's Visibility (Isaiah 6 vs. Exodus 33)

Isaiah 6:1,5 reports: "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne... my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!" Yet [Exodus 33:20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_33) states: "You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live."

#### Explanations
- **Theophany vs. Direct Vision:** Isaiah saw a vision or theophany (divine manifestation) rather than God's direct essence. Exodus refers to seeing God's full, unmediated glory.
- **Degrees of Revelation:** God reveals Himself in various ways and degrees. No human can see God's essential being directly, but God grants visions of His glory adapted to human capacity.

## Credibility

The credibility of Isaiah rests primarily on the fulfillment of its prophecies. Below are all prophetic passages organized by their fulfillment classification.

### Historically Accurate

Every measurable aspect of these prophecies was fulfilled according to historians. These prophecies demonstrate Isaiah's divine inspiration through accurately predicting specific historical events that came to pass exactly as foretold.

### Christian Fulfillment

Every aspect of these prophecies was completely fulfilled according to Jesus or the apostles, but not according to the Jews. These represent the core messianic prophecies that Christians believe Jesus fully accomplished during his earthly ministry and through his death and resurrection. If there was only one or two such prophecies, skeptics might attribute it to chance. But with this long list completely fulfilled by one person from only one book (ignoring prophecies from other biblical books), the statistical probability becomes very low.

### Partially Fulfilled

Only some aspects of these prophecies were fulfilled, representing dual fulfillment prophecies. Jesus accomplished part of the prophecy during his First Coming (earthly ministry, death, and resurrection), while the remaining aspects await fulfillment at his Second Coming. This doesn't mean these are errors, but rather, they demonstrate how God's prophetic plan unfolds in stages across redemptive history.

### Biblical Fulfillment

Old Testament biblical authors agree these prophecies were fulfilled, but no historic evidence can be provided. These represent miraculous events recorded only in Scripture without independent verification.

| Verse         | Prophecy                                                                             |

### Future Fulfillment

No aspect of these prophecies has yet been fulfilled, however it is still possible that they may be fulfilled in the future. Both Jewish and Christian eschatology view these as promises awaiting the Messianic Age or the Second Coming.

### Debatable Prophecies

Conflicting strong evidence could be provided that these prophecies were fulfilled or unfulfilled, but it depends on the prophecy's interpretation. These cases involve textual complexity or historical ambiguity.

| Verse       | Prophecy                                                                             |
