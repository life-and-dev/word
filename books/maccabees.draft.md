# The Books of Maccabees (1-4 Maccabees)

## Authorship

The four Books of Maccabees represent distinct literary works written by different anonymous authors across different time periods and geographical locations, each with unique theological and literary perspectives.

### 1 Maccabees

The author of [1 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maccabees) remains anonymous and unknown to scholars. However, based on internal evidence and the book's perspective, scholars have drawn several conclusions about the author's identity and background. The author was likely a **Palestinian Jew** who was fluent in Hebrew and Aramaic, writing in the newly independent Hasmonean kingdom during the reign of High Priest John Hyrcanus I (reigned approximately 135/134–104 BCE). Some scholars suggest the author may have been the **Hasmonean court historian** or someone with an equivalent official position, given his access to official documents and his distinctly pro-Hasmonean perspective.

The book was **originally composed in Hebrew**, as attested by both Origen and Jerome, who claimed to have seen Hebrew manuscripts. However, this original Hebrew version has been lost, and the work survives only in its Greek translation preserved in the Septuagint. The [Jewish Encyclopedia](https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10237-maccabees-books-of) notes that the primary reason for the disappearance of Hebrew versions has to do with the unpopularity of the Hasmonean dynasty in the centuries following the Maccabean Revolt.

Scholars universally agree that 1 Maccabees was **written before 63 BCE**, as the author displays great admiration toward Rome and shows no knowledge of the Roman general Pompey conquering Jerusalem and reducing the Hasmonean kingdom to a client state of the Roman Republic in that year. The author's nationalism and the exaggerated importance given to Judean events have led some scholars to question his objectivity, particularly noting his anti-Seleucid bias. Nevertheless, the [historical integrity of the book](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Books-of-the-Maccabees) is generally respected, as it was compiled from official written sources, oral tradition, and eyewitness reporting, with an absence of most conventions of the Hellenistic rhetorical school of historiography.

The work is distinctly **pro-Hasmonean**, propagating what some scholars call "Hasmonean propaganda" in upholding the righteousness of the Hasmoneans and their just claim to rule. The author seeks to promote the view that the Hasmoneans were God's newly chosen rulers in line with the heroes of the Hebrew Bible, regarding them as chosen by Providence "to give deliverance unto Israel." Some scholarly debate exists about the sectarian identification of the author—Geiger's thesis that 1 Maccabees was Sadducean did not win much support, as the work does not explicitly mention Zadokites, Sadducees, or Pharisees.

### 2 Maccabees

The author of [2 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees) is also not identified, but he explicitly claims to be **abridging a five-volume work by Jason of Cyrene**. This makes 2 Maccabees unique among the Maccabean books in that it acknowledges its source material, though Jason's original work has been lost. The author was an **unknown diaspora Jew living in Hellenistic Egypt**, writing in Greek with no evidence of an earlier Hebrew version.

Scholars suggest 2 Maccabees was composed between **150–100 BCE**, though some argue for dates as late as 124 BCE based on letters inserted at the beginning of the book (dated to 188 Seleucid Era, or ~124 BCE). The book must have been written before 40 CE and certainly before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Unlike 1 Maccabees, this work shows less concern for political history and more interest in theological reflection, miraculous interventions, and the temple cult, reflecting its different authorial perspective and audience.

### 3 Maccabees

[3 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Maccabees) was written by an **Alexandrian Jew** who composed the work in Greek. All scholars agree on the Greek composition, which is evident from the free, idiomatic, and rather bombastic character of the language in the Septuagint. The book is actually **misnamed**, as it has nothing to do with the Maccabees or the Maccabean Revolt. Instead, it recounts a story of persecution of Jews in Egypt under Ptolemy IV Philopator (222–205 BCE).

Though it contains some historical elements, the story is largely considered **historical fiction** rather than historical record. The precise date of authorship is unknown, but the widest plausible range is between **100 BCE and 70 CE**. [Some scholars](https://www.internationalstandardbible.com/M/maccabees-books-of-3-5.html), including Ewald, Hausrath, and Reuss, believed it was written during the reign of Emperor Caligula (37–41 CE), when Alexandrian Jews faced persecution, suggesting the book was written to comfort and encourage Jews during that crisis. Neither 3 nor 4 Maccabees has any claim to canonicity in most Christian traditions, though 3 Maccabees received favorable consideration in some Eastern Churches for a time and is included in some Orthodox canons.

### 4 Maccabees

[4 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Maccabees) is fundamentally different in genre from the other books—it is a **Jewish-Stoic philosophical treatise** or sermon on the question of "Whether pious reason is absolute master of the passions." The work uses the martyrdom stories of Eleazar and the seven brothers from 2 Maccabees 6:18–7 to illustrate the author's philosophical thesis.

The authorship was once incorrectly ascribed to **Josephus** by Eusebius, Jerome, and others, but this attribution is universally rejected by modern scholars. The author was probably a **diaspora Jew**, though the specific location is debated. The author was likely not from Roman Judea, as the book includes a minor geographical mistake about the layout of Jerusalem, and the tone suggests the defense of a cultural minority in a Hellenistic environment. While Alexandria was the largest center of literary Greek Jewish works in the era, scholars such as Hans Freudenthal and Eduard Norden argue that the religious outlook of the book does not easily match Alexandrian Jewish thought.

The **first century CE** is generally accepted as the date of composition, primarily because the book must have been written before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. The work has a clearly **Stoic stamp**, seeking to demonstrate that "pious reason exercises mastery over the emotions" (4 Maccabees 1:1). The adjective "pious" is critically important: the author is modifying the common Stoic topic ("reason can master the emotions") to suggest that it is specifically the mind trained in Jewish piety and the practices of the Jewish Law that is equipped to exercise the mastery that Greek ethicists praised. This represents a sophisticated synthesis of Greek philosophical thought with Jewish theology.

In summary, the four Books of Maccabees represent diverse authorial perspectives: 1 Maccabees as Palestinian court history, 2 Maccabees as diaspora theological history, 3 Maccabees as Alexandrian didactic fiction, and 4 Maccabees as philosophical-religious discourse. Their anonymous authors wrote from different locations (Palestine and the diaspora), in different languages (Hebrew and Greek), at different times (spanning roughly 150 BCE to 70 CE), and for different purposes, making them a rich collection of Second Temple Jewish literature rather than a unified work.

## Historical Environment

The Books of Maccabees emerge from distinct historical contexts spanning from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. 1 Maccabees, a pro-Hasmonean chronicle, was written in an independent Judea (c. 135-104 BCE) to legitimize the ruling dynasty. In contrast, 2 Maccabees (c. 150-100 BCE) reflects a diaspora Jewish perspective from Hellenistic Egypt, emphasizing theological themes like martyrdom and resurrection. 3 Maccabees is a fictional work from Alexandria (c. 100 BCE-70 CE) intended to encourage Jews facing persecution. Finally, 4 Maccabees (c. 20-70 CE) is a philosophical treatise from the Roman period, synthesizing Stoic philosophy with Jewish piety to defend Torah observance in a Greco-Roman world.

## Purpose

The four Books of Maccabees were written for distinctly different purposes, reflecting their diverse authorial perspectives, audiences, and theological concerns. Understanding these purposes is crucial for properly interpreting each work.

### 1 Maccabees: Legitimizing the Hasmonean Dynasty

The primary purpose of [1 Maccabees](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-book-of-first-maccabees/) was to **legitimize the Hasmonean dynasty's claim to political and religious leadership** of Judea. Written circa 134-104 BCE in Hebrew for a Judean audience in biblical style, the book emphasizes how God specifically chose the Hasmonean family to save Israel from Seleucid oppression and foreign domination.

**Political Legitimization:** As a court historian who supported the Hasmonean dynasty, the author attempted to **glorify Mattathias and his descendants** and to justify their rule, including the eradication of their Jewish political opponents. The book makes clear that God has specifically chosen a new dynasty to rule Judea—the Hasmoneans—in the tradition of the judges and kings of ancient Israel. The narrative culminates in a detailed description of the people's assembly that ratified Simon's claim to the high priesthood and the governorship, providing democratic legitimacy to Hasmonean rule.

**Religious Legitimization:** A crucial issue was that the Hasmoneans were not descended from the Zadokite line that traditionally held the high priesthood. By presenting the Hasmoneans as divinely chosen deliverers comparable to biblical heroes like Moses, Joshua, and David, the author sought to overcome objections to their religious authority. The book portrays God working through the Hasmonean family to restore proper Temple worship and Torah observance after the Seleucid desecration.

**Military Valor Over Martyrdom:** Significantly, 1 Maccabees comes across as **dismissive of martyrdom** and passive approaches to resistance, seeing such gestures as futile and pointless. Some scholars, including Jonathan Goldstein, argue that the author has "considerable contempt for martyrs." For this author, bold military action while living is the proper response to oppression—a perspective that supports the Hasmoneans' militaristic approach to securing Jewish independence.

**Connection to Hanukkah:** [1 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maccabees) is best known for its account of the **recapture of Jerusalem in 164 BCE** and the **rededication of the Second Temple**—the origin behind the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. The book describes how in 165 BCE the Temple was freed and reconsecrated so that ritual sacrifices could resume. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted by Judas Maccabeus and his brothers to celebrate this event, establishing an eight-day celebration modeled on the Feast of Tabernacles.

### 2 Maccabees: Theological Interpretation and Diaspora Encouragement

In stark contrast to 1 Maccabees, [2 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees) is **not interested in the Hasmonean dynasty**. While Judah Maccabee is portrayed as a hero, not a word is said about his father Mattathias or the Hasmonean dynasty that Judah's brother Simon would found. The theory is that 2 Maccabees praises Judas for saving the Temple but deliberately excludes mention of how his brothers and extended family later took the throne. This omission may indicate either that the book was composed before the dynasty became established or that the author had theological objections to the Hasmoneans' political rule.

**Theological Interpretation:** [2 Maccabees is written as a theological interpretation](https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-maccabean-victory-explained-between-1-and-2-maccabees) of the Maccabean Revolt rather than as political history. The author's concern is to explain the theological meaning of the persecution, martyrdom, and deliverance experienced by the Jewish people. The literary style chosen by Jason of Cyrene (whose work the author abridges) **highlights martyrdom** using a melodramatic Greek style that describes graphically the deaths of innocent children, women, and elderly people.

**Resurrection Theology:** Unlike 1 Maccabees, which makes no reference to bodily resurrection and contains no doctrine of individual immortality except in the survival of one's name and fame, [2 Maccabees has a more overt theological agenda](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-book-of-second-maccabees/) focused on **resurrection of the dead**. The book contrasts righteous martyrs who will be resurrected with apostates who face eternal punishment. 2 Maccabees discusses several doctrinal issues, including **prayers and sacrifices for the dead**, **intercession of the saints**, and **resurrection on Judgment Day**—theological innovations that would become important in later Jewish and Christian thought.

**Martyrdom as Vicarious Atonement:** In 2 Maccabees, there is a unique emphasis on **religious martyrdom**. Hannah (the mother) and her seven sons, along with Eleazar the elderly scribe, are presented as philosophers rationally defending the decision to die rather than abandon their ancestral faith. Their deaths are seen not only as a way to sanctify God's name (kiddush ha-Shem) but as a way to **vicariously remove the sins of Israel** and to evoke supernatural intervention by God. This theology of martyrdom stands in direct opposition to 1 Maccabees' militaristic ethos.

**Diaspora Audience:** Written for diaspora Jewish communities, particularly in Egypt, the book addresses questions about how to maintain Jewish identity in Hellenistic contexts. Its emphasis on martyrdom, resurrection, and divine judgment provided theological resources for Jews under cultural and occasionally physical pressure to assimilate. The beginning of 2 Maccabees includes **two letters sent by Jews in Jerusalem to Jews of the diaspora** in Hellenistic Egypt encouraging the celebration of the feast day set up to honor the purification of the Temple (Hanukkah), showing its concern for diaspora-homeland connections.

### 3 Maccabees: Encouragement Through Divine Deliverance

[3 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Maccabees), despite its misleading name, has nothing to do with the Maccabean Revolt. Its purpose was to **encourage Alexandrian Jews** during times of persecution by recounting (or inventing) a story of divine deliverance from persecution in Egypt.

**Encouragement in Crisis:** The book was likely written to **comfort and encourage Alexandrian Jews** during times of persecution, possibly during the reign of Emperor Caligula (37-41 CE), when severe anti-Jewish violence occurred in Alexandria. By presenting a narrative of miraculous deliverance from past persecution, the author sought to inspire hope that God would similarly deliver the current generation.

**Liturgical Purpose:** The story purports to explain the **origin of a Purim-like festival** celebrated by Egyptian Jews, establishing a religious observance commemorating God's deliverance. This suggests a practical liturgical purpose beyond mere encouragement—the book provides an etiological foundation for an existing festival practice.

**Positive Tone:** The tone is largely positive, with **glad thanksgivings for God's deliverance** rather than thundering apocalyptic proclamations. The author emphasizes that "The Jews continued to maintain goodwill and unswerving loyalty towards the [Ptolemaic] dynasty," encouraging Jews to remain loyal citizens while maintaining their religious distinctiveness. This represents a strategy of peaceful coexistence rather than resistance or separation.

### 4 Maccabees: Philosophical Defense of Torah Observance

[4 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Maccabees) has the most explicitly philosophical purpose among the Maccabean books. It seeks to demonstrate that **"pious reason exercises mastery over the emotions"** (4 Maccabees 1:1), using the martyrdom stories from 2 Maccabees as illustrations of this philosophical thesis.

**Synthesis of Judaism and Greek Philosophy:** The book's primary purpose is to show that **Jewish Torah observance produces the virtues** that Greek philosophy values, particularly the Stoic ideal of rational self-mastery over passions and emotions. Rather than presenting Judaism as incompatible with Greek culture, the author argues that authentic Jewish practice fulfills the highest ideals of Greek philosophy. This represents a sophisticated apologetic strategy for Jews living in a Hellenistic cultural environment.

**Endorsement of Fidelity to Torah:** The book functions as an **endorsement of fidelity to Jewish customs and law** and **against assimilation** to Gentile practice where this conflicted with the Torah. By demonstrating that the martyrs acted rationally in choosing death over Torah violation, the author counters the argument that Jewish dietary laws, circumcision, and other distinctive practices are irrational or unnecessary.

**Rational Martyrdom:** [4 Maccabees recasts the martyrdom story](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/wholecounsel/2018/11/08/4-maccabees-martyrdom-and-reason/) as one of **reason and logic**: the martyrs will be rewarded in the afterlife, so it is rational to continue to obey Jewish law, even at the risk of torture and death. This transforms martyrdom from an emotional or fanatical act into a carefully reasoned philosophical decision, making it respectable in Greco-Roman cultural terms.

**Vicarious Atonement:** Like 2 Maccabees, but with more explicit theological development, **the suffering and martyrdom of the Maccabees is seen as vicarious** for the Jewish nation. The author portrays martyrdom in general as bringing **atonement for the past sins** of the Jews, developing a theology of redemptive suffering that would become central to Christian thought about the crucifixion of Jesus.

**Early Christian Martyrology:** The narrative reflects Second Temple Jewish understanding of martyrdom in its fullest form, with all the elements that characterize **early Christian martyrology** present: the heroic resistance of the martyrs to the denial of their faith, the characterization of their tortures as a struggle or contest over which they are victorious by being willing to go to their deaths, and the urging of close family members and friends not to save themselves by denial but to endure even unto death.

### Summary of Purposes

The four Books of Maccabees serve very different purposes:

- **1 Maccabees**: Political legitimization of Hasmonean rule; celebration of military resistance; establishment of Hanukkah; dismissive of martyrdom
- **2 Maccabees**: Theological interpretation of persecution and deliverance; development of resurrection theology; elevation of martyrdom; encouragement for diaspora Jews; promotion of Hanukkah observance
- **3 Maccabees**: Encouragement during persecution through narratives of divine deliverance; etiological explanation for a festival; promotion of loyal citizenship with religious fidelity
- **4 Maccabees**: Philosophical defense of Torah observance using Greek categories; rational justification for martyrdom; development of vicarious atonement theology; resistance to assimilation

These diverse purposes reflect the different challenges faced by Jewish communities over three centuries: establishing political independence, maintaining religious identity in diaspora, surviving persecution, and articulating Jewish distinctiveness within Hellenistic culture.

## Cross-References

While the Books of Maccabees are not part of the Protestant canon and are considered deuterocanonical or apocryphal by various Christian traditions, they have significant connections to both Old Testament prophecies and New Testament writings. These cross-references demonstrate the books' influence on early Christian thought and their role in connecting biblical prophecy with historical events.

### Old Testament Connections

#### Daniel's Prophecies and the Abomination of Desolation

The most significant Old Testament connection is between the **Book of Daniel** and **1 Maccabees**. The Jewish authors of [1 Maccabees believed that Antiochus IV Epiphanes' actions](https://conciliarpost.com/theology-spirituality/maccabees-in-the-new-testament/) in the Temple were the **"abomination of desolation"** prophesied by Daniel. This phrase appears in:

- **Daniel 9:27**: "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate"
- **Daniel 11:31**: "And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate"
- **Daniel 12:11**: "And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days"
- **1 Maccabees 1:54** (1:57 Douay): Describes how Antiochus erected the "abomination of desolation" upon the altar in 167 BCE

This connection establishes 1 Maccabees as a historical fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy, providing a concrete interpretive framework for understanding apocalyptic literature.

### New Testament Allusions and References

Although the Books of Maccabees are never explicitly quoted in the New Testament, there are several significant allusions and thematic connections that demonstrate early Christian familiarity with and use of Maccabean literature.

#### Hebrews 11:35-38 and the Maccabean Martyrs

The most widely recognized connection is between **Hebrews 11:35b** and the martyrdom accounts in **2 Maccabees 6-7**. [The reference to the Maccabean martyrs in Hebrews 11:35b](https://conciliarpost.com/theology-spirituality/maccabees-in-the-new-testament/) has long been recognized in biblical scholarship.

**Hebrews 11:35-38** states:
> "Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; and others experienced mocking and flogging, and further, chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented (people of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground."

This passage appears to reference:

- **2 Maccabees 7:1-42**: The story of the mother and her seven sons who were **tortured and killed** rather than violate Jewish dietary laws. The mother tells one of her sons: "The Creator of the world...will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again" (2 Maccabees 7:23), demonstrating belief in resurrection.
- **2 Maccabees 6:19-31**: The martyrdom of the 90-year-old scribe **Eleazar**, who was tortured to death for refusing to eat pork. The word **"tympanizo"** (to 'tympanize') used in Hebrews 11:35 refers to a form of severe torture also described in 2 Maccabees 6:19-29.

[Those of Roman Catholic persuasion argue](https://www.academia.edu/113777951/The_Canonical_Implications_of_Hebrews_11_35b_and_2_Maccabees) these verses are at least an allusion to 2 Maccabees 7:1, 13-14, if not a direct reference. While we do not have explicit citations of 2 Maccabees in the New Testament, the evidence for the book's use is quite clear.

#### John 10:22-23 and the Feast of Dedication (Hanukkah)

**John 10:22-23** mentions Jesus observing the **Feast of Dedication** (Hanukkah):
> "At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon."

The [Feast of Hanukkah comes from the events](https://conciliarpost.com/theology-spirituality/maccabees-in-the-new-testament/) in:
- **1 Maccabees 4:36-59**: Describes the cleansing and rededication of the Temple by Judas Maccabeus
- **2 Maccabees 10:1-8**: Another account of the Temple rededication

Jesus almost certainly was aware of the events surrounding the Maccabean Revolt, and the Gospels portray Jesus as keeping Jewish festivals, including Hanukkah. This demonstrates that the Maccabean history and the festival it established were integral to Second Temple Judaism as practiced by Jesus.

#### Jesus and the Future Abomination of Desolation

[Jesus takes the common Jewish understanding of Daniel](https://dustinmartyr.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/how-jesus-understood-daniels-abomination-of-desolation/) in a new direction, referring to the **"abomination of desolation"** several times:

- **Matthew 24:15**: "Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)"
- **Mark 13:14**: "But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains"
- **Luke 21:20** (cf.): "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near"

Significantly, Jesus always speaks of the abomination of desolation in the **future tense**. When Jesus gave this warning, this part of Daniel's prophecy had been fulfilled almost 200 years earlier by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (as recorded in 1 Maccabees). Jesus' appeal to Daniel's "abomination of desolation" should be understood in a **typological sense**—the crisis of long ago, which threatened to bring Judaism to an end, will once again threaten Israel and Jesus' followers. This establishes a pattern of interpretation where the Maccabean crisis serves as a type or foreshadowing of future tribulation.

#### 2 Maccabees and New Testament Resurrection Theology

[2 Maccabees discusses several doctrinal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees), including **prayers and sacrifices for the dead**, **intercession of the saints**, and **resurrection on Judgment Day**—theological innovations that would become important in later Jewish and Christian thought.

**2 Maccabees 12:42-46** describes Judas Maccabeus taking up a collection to provide for a sin offering for slain soldiers who died wearing idolatrous amulets:
> "In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view; for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin."

This passage represents **the earliest statement of the doctrine** that prayers (v. 42) and sacrifices (v. 43) for the dead are efficacious. While similar to Catholic purgatory doctrine, it is not quite the same.

A possible New Testament connection appears in **2 Timothy 1:18**, where St. Paul prays for **Onesiphorus**, who has apparently died: "May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day."

#### Common Motifs Between Maccabees and Hebrews

[Several common motifs and linguistic similarities](https://www.academia.edu/16196766/The_Maccabean_Literature_and_Hebrews) between the books of the Maccabees and the book of Hebrews have been noted by scholars:

- The **Abrahamic promise and the Akedah** (binding of Isaac)
- **Priests with royal functions**
- **Faith heroes and endurance**
- **Instruction of the Scriptures**
- The **Canticum Mosis** (Song of Moses)

**Mattathias' speech** in 1 Maccabees 2 includes exhortations that parallel themes in Hebrews:
- "Now therefore, children, be zealous for the law..." (1 Maccabees 2:50)
- "Remember the works of our fathers..." (1 Maccabees 2:51)
- "Children, be brave, and be strong in the law, for by it you will be glorified" (1 Maccabees 2:64)

These themes resonate with Hebrews' emphasis on faith, endurance, and the examples of the ancestors.

### Influence on Early Christian Martyrology

The martyrdom accounts in 2 and 4 Maccabees profoundly influenced **early Christian martyrology**. The narrative reflects Second Temple Jewish understanding of martyrdom in its fullest form, with all the elements that characterize early Christian martyrology present:

- The heroic **resistance of the martyrs** to the denial of their faith
- The characterization of their **tortures as a struggle or contest** over which they are victorious by being willing to go to their deaths
- The urging of **close family members and friends** not to save themselves by denial but to endure even unto death
- The concept of **vicarious atonement** through martyrdom

First-century Jews—both those who followed Jesus and those who did not—shared common views on martyrdom derived from Maccabean literature, which later became very important in Christianity.

### Statistical Summary

While no formal statistical analysis has been done on quotations of the Maccabees in the New Testament (since there are no direct quotations), the following can be noted:

- **Direct quotations**: 0 (none in the Protestant or Catholic New Testament)
- **Clear allusions**: At least 2 (Hebrews 11:35 to 2 Maccabees 6-7; John 10:22 to 1-2 Maccabees 4/10)
- **Thematic influences**: Multiple (resurrection theology, martyrdom theology, vicarious atonement, typological interpretation of prophecy)
- **Theological concepts**: Several key doctrines in 2 Maccabees influenced New Testament theology, including bodily resurrection, prayers for the dead, and intercession of saints

The Books of Maccabees, while not formally canonical in Protestant traditions, clearly influenced the theological and historical understanding of early Christians, particularly regarding martyrdom, resurrection, and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.

## Canonical Status

The canonical status of the Books of Maccabees varies significantly across different religious traditions, with 1 and 2 Maccabees accepted as deuterocanonical by Catholic and Orthodox churches, while Protestant churches classify them as apocrypha. The books have never been part of the Jewish canon. 3 Maccabees holds a more limited acceptance in Eastern Orthodoxy, and 4 Maccabees is canonical only in the Georgian Orthodox Church. Understanding the reasons for these different canonical judgments requires examining historical, linguistic, theological, and ecclesiastical evidence.

### Jewish Canon: Excluded from the Tanakh

**All four Books of Maccabees were never included in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh)** and are not considered canonical by any of the major branches of Judaism today. This exclusion requires explanation, particularly since 1 and 2 Maccabees deal with one of the most celebrated events in Jewish history—the Maccabean Revolt and the origin of Hanukkah.

[Judaism regards the Age of Prophecy](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/omitting-the-maccabees/) as having ended about 2400 years ago (approximately 400 BCE), before the Hanukkah story occurred (167-164 BCE). According to Jewish tradition, anything written after this point was no longer "Divinely inspired" in the same way as the canonical Hebrew scriptures. The books were written during the Second Temple period, after the traditional closing of the prophetic canon.

Additionally, the **unpopularity of the Hasmonean dynasty** in the centuries following the Maccabean Revolt contributed to the books' exclusion. As mentioned in the Authorship section, the Hasmoneans eventually became hellenized themselves and engaged in political corruption, which led to Jewish disillusionment with the dynasty. The primary reason for no Hebrew versions of 1 Maccabees surviving has to do with this unpopularity—the original Hebrew text was apparently not preserved by the Jewish community.

However, paradoxically, both 1 and 2 Maccabees **were included in the Septuagint**, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible originally prepared for the Jewish community of Alexandria in the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE. This Septuagint inclusion would later prove crucial for their acceptance in Christian canons.

### Catholic Canon: Deuterocanonical Status for 1 and 2 Maccabees

The [Catholic Church officially pronounced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books) **1 and 2 Maccabees as canonical** at the **Council of Trent** in 1546, listing "the two books of Maccabees, the first and the second" as sacred and canonical. However, this was not the first time these books had been recognized as canonical in Christian tradition.

**Early Church Councils** had previously affirmed the canonicity of 1 and 2 Maccabees:
- **Council of Rome** (382 CE under Pope Damasus I)
- **Council of Hippo** (393 CE)
- **Third Council of Carthage** (397 CE)
- **Council of Carthage** (419 CE)
- **Council of Florence** (1442 CE)

These councils consistently included the books of Maccabees in the canon from the 300s through the 1400s, long before the Protestant Reformation. The Council of Trent's declaration was primarily a **response to the Protestant Reformation**, which had rejected these books as non-canonical.

**Why the Catholic Church Included Them:**

1. **Septuagint Usage**: The early Church used the **Septuagint** as its primary Old Testament source until the fifth century. Since the Septuagint contained 1 and 2 Maccabees (along with other deuterocanonical books), the early Church naturally regarded them as Scripture.

2. **Early Church Fathers**: Many Church Fathers cited the books as authoritative Scripture, demonstrating their widespread acceptance in the early Church.

3. **Theological Value**: The books contain important theological teachings, particularly 2 Maccabees' emphasis on **resurrection of the dead**, **prayers for the dead** (2 Maccabees 12:42-46), **intercession of the saints**, and **vicarious atonement through martyrdom**—doctrines that became important in Catholic theology.

4. **Historical Continuity**: The Catholic Church emphasized continuity with the tradition of the early Church, which had consistently recognized these books.

**Why 3 and 4 Maccabees Are Not in the Catholic Canon:**

[Catholic Answers explains](https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-are-3-and-4-maccabees-not-in-the-bible) that 3 and 4 Maccabees were not included in the Latin Vulgate translation by St. Jerome, which became the standard Bible of the Western Church. Since the Western Church relied heavily on the Vulgate, books not included in it did not achieve canonical status in the Catholic tradition. Additionally, the historical and theological value of 3 and 4 Maccabees was considered less significant than 1 and 2 Maccabees.

### Protestant Canon: Apocryphal Status

During the **Protestant Reformation**, Maccabees (along with other books in the Catholic deuterocanon) was **classed as biblical apocrypha** in Protestantism—material useful for background and edification but not canonical. The **1643 Westminster Confession** declared these books "are of no authority in the Church of God."

**Why Protestants Excluded Them:**

1. **Hebrew Canon Principle**: Reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin sought a return to what they believed to be the **original Hebrew canon**. They argued that the Old Testament should only contain books that were part of the Hebrew Bible used by the Jews. Since 1 Maccabees was originally written in Hebrew but that version was lost, and 2 Maccabees was written in Greek with no Hebrew original, they reasoned these books were not part of the original Jewish Scriptures.

2. **Language Issues**: The fact that **1 Maccabees survives only in Greek translation** (the original Hebrew having been lost) and **2 Maccabees was written in Greek** raised questions about their status as Hebrew Scripture. Protestants gave priority to books that existed in the Hebrew Masoretic Text.

3. **Doctrinal Concerns**: Significant theological objections existed, particularly regarding **2 Maccabees 12:42-46**, which teaches that believers should **pray for the dead** and supports concepts like **purgatory** and **intercession of angels**. These teachings conflicted with Protestant doctrines, especially the principle of "**Salvation by grace alone**" (sola gratia) and the rejection of purgatory.

4. **Historical Precedent**: The Reformers noted that some early Church authorities, including **St. Jerome** (translator of the Latin Vulgate), had expressed reservations about the deuterocanonical books, distinguishing them from the books in the Hebrew canon.

### Eastern Orthodox Canon: Broader Acceptance

The [Eastern Orthodox canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books) includes the deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church **plus additional books**, including **1 Esdras and 3 Maccabees**. The **Synod of Jerusalem in 1672** declared "The Maccabees" as "genuine parts of Scripture."

**1 and 2 Maccabees**: Fully canonical, accepted with the same status as in Catholicism.

**3 Maccabees**: [3 Maccabees is included in the deuterocanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Maccabees) of the **Eastern Orthodox Church** and some **Oriental Orthodox Churches** (Armenian Apostolic, Syriac Orthodox) as well as the **Assyrian Church of the East**. The **Council in Trullo in 692 CE** verified that 1, 2, and 3 Maccabees were deuterocanonical.

However, despite its canonical status, [3 Maccabees has been relatively neglected](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/105171/why-has-3-maccabees-been-neglected) over time:

- **Not in the Latin Vulgate**: The book was not translated into the Latin Vulgate, leading to the Western Church's rejection of it even as deuterocanonical.
- **Limited Ancient References**: No Jewish writers of the ancient era appear to reference it or be familiar with it, even those who wrote in Greek.
- **Rarely Referenced**: While kept in the Greek-speaking Eastern Church's scripture, it is only very rarely referenced or alluded to in liturgy or theological writing.
- **Lower Theological Value**: People did not believe 3 and 4 Maccabees had the same theological value as the first two books.

**4 Maccabees**: The [Council in Trullo's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Maccabees) included the first three books of Maccabees but **did not include 4 Maccabees as canonical** in the broader Orthodox tradition.

### Georgian Orthodox Canon: Unique Status of 4 Maccabees

The **Georgian Orthodox Church** is the **only church which considers 4 Maccabees canonical**. However, even this status has evolved:

- **Historical Practice**: Historically, the Greek Orthodox Church and the Georgian Orthodox Church printed 4 Maccabees in their Bibles together with the rest of the Old Testament, but this **did not necessarily entail** that they officially considered 4 Maccabees "canonical."
- **Recent Changes**: More recently, the **Greek Church moved it to an appendix**, and a recent Georgian Bible marks it as **"noncanonical,"** suggesting a shift in its status even within Georgian Orthodoxy.

### Scholarly Debates About Canonicity

Modern scholarship has produced several debates regarding the canonical status of the Maccabees:

#### 1. **Language and Original Text Debate**

The question of whether a book must exist in Hebrew to be considered part of the Old Testament canon remains contentious:
- **1 Maccabees**: Both Origen and Jerome claimed to have seen Hebrew manuscripts, but no Hebrew text survives today. Does the loss of the original Hebrew text affect its canonical status?
- **2 Maccabees**: Written originally in Greek with no evidence of a Hebrew version. Can a book composed in Greek be considered part of the Hebrew Bible?

#### 2. **Septuagint vs. Masoretic Text Priority**

- The early Church used the **Septuagint** (which included Maccabees), while later Jewish tradition standardized around the **Masoretic Text** (which excluded them).
- Should the Church follow the broader Septuagint canon used by early Christians, or the narrower Hebrew canon used by Jews?

#### 3. **Doctrinal Influence on Canon Formation**

Critics argue that **doctrinal preferences** influenced canonical decisions:
- Catholics accepted books that supported their theology (prayers for the dead, purgatory, good works)
- Protestants rejected books that contradicted their theology (salvation by faith alone, rejection of purgatory)
- How much should theological compatibility affect canonical decisions? Should canon be determined by theology or should theology be determined by canon?

#### 4. **Historical Reliability and Inspiration**

Some scholars question whether historical works (even accurate ones like 1 Maccabees) should be considered divinely inspired Scripture, or whether they should be valued as historical sources without canonical status.

### Summary of Canonical Status by Tradition

| Book | Jewish | Catholic | Protestant | Eastern Orthodox | Georgian Orthodox |
|------|--------|----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **1 Maccabees** | Not canonical | Deuterocanonical | Apocrypha | Deuterocanonical | Deuterocanonical |
| **2 Maccabees** | Not canonical | Deuterocanonical | Apocrypha | Deuterocanonical | Deuterocanonical |
| **3 Maccabees** | Not canonical | Not canonical | Not included | Deuterocanonical | Deuterocanonical |
| **4 Maccabees** | Not canonical | Not canonical | Not included | Appendix (not canonical) | Disputed/Appendix |

### Evidence-Based Considerations

Rather than appealing to ecclesiastical authority alone, several evidence-based considerations inform the canonical debate:

1. **Ancient Usage**: Which books did the earliest Jewish and Christian communities use as Scripture?
2. **Manuscript Evidence**: Which books were included in ancient biblical manuscripts and codices?
3. **Theological Coherence**: Do the books cohere theologically with undisputed canonical books?
4. **Historical Accuracy**: How reliable are the books as historical sources?
5. **Spiritual Impact**: Have the books demonstrably edified and guided faith communities throughout history?

The Books of Maccabees present a complex case because they score differently on these criteria depending on the tradition evaluating them. The canonical status of these books remains one of the significant differences between Christian denominations, though all traditions recognize their historical and theological value even when disagreeing about their canonical authority.

## Summary

The four Books of Maccabees together provide a multifaceted account of Jewish resistance to Hellenistic oppression, spanning historical narrative, theological reflection, didactic fiction, and philosophical discourse. While these books contain relatively little direct divine speech (compared to the prophetic books), they emphasize God's providence, the importance of Torah observance, and the power of faithful endurance.

### 1 Maccabees: Historical Chronicle of the Maccabean Revolt

**The Seleucid Crisis (1 Maccabees 1-2)**: The book begins with Alexander the Great's conquest and the division of his empire (1 Maccabees 1:1-9). After Alexander's death, his kingdom was divided among his officers, bringing many evils upon the earth (1 Maccabees 1:9). The crisis intensifies when Antiochus IV Epiphanes ascends the Seleucid throne and begins his aggressive Hellenization program.

Antiochus outlaws core Jewish practices, decreeing that the people "should abandon their own laws and customs" (1 Maccabees 1:42). He forbids burnt offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings in the sanctuary, commands that they profane sabbaths and feasts, defile the sanctuary and the priests, build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, and sacrifice swine and unclean animals (1 Maccabees 1:44-47). The penalty for disobedience is death (1 Maccabees 1:50).

Most infamously, on the fifteenth day of Chislev in the 145th year (167 BCE), Antiochus erected "a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of burnt offering" (1 Maccabees 1:54)—the abomination of desolation prophesied in Daniel. Many in Israel stood firm and refused to defile themselves with food or to profane the holy covenant, choosing death rather than compromise (1 Maccabees 1:62-63).

**The Revolt Begins (1 Maccabees 2)**: The narrative turns to Mattathias, a priest from the line of Joarib, who lived in Modein with his five sons: John, Simon, Judas (called Maccabeus), Eleazar, and Jonathan (1 Maccabees 2:1-5). When Seleucid officers come to enforce the pagan sacrifices, Mattathias refuses: "Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him and have chosen to do his commandments, departing each one from the religion of his fathers, yet I and my sons and my brothers will live by the covenant of our fathers" (1 Maccabees 2:19-20).

When a fellow Jew steps forward to offer the pagan sacrifice, Mattathias, burning with zeal for the Law, kills both the Jewish apostate and the king's officer, tears down the altar, and cries out: "Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!" (1 Maccabees 2:23-27). This echoes Phinehas's zeal in Numbers 25, and Mattathias's action initiates the Maccabean Revolt.

Before his death, Mattathias delivers a farewell address exhorting his sons: "Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our ancestors" (1 Maccabees 2:50). He recalls the faithful heroes of Israel's past—Abraham, Joseph, Phinehas, Joshua, Caleb, David, Elijah, Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, and Daniel—demonstrating that those who trust in God will not lack strength (1 Maccabees 2:51-61). He appoints Simon as counselor and Judas Maccabeus as military commander (1 Maccabees 2:65-66), then dies in 166 BCE.

**Judas Maccabeus's Leadership (1 Maccabees 3-9)**: Judas Maccabeus takes command and wins a series of remarkable military victories against numerically superior Seleucid forces. Before battles, Judas leads his forces in prayer, acknowledging God as the source of victory. Before confronting Gorgias, Judas prays: "Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who crushed the attack of the mighty warrior by the hand of your servant David... So do to this army before us today" (1 Maccabees 4:30-33).

The pinnacle of Judas's achievements is the recapture and rededication of Jerusalem and the Temple in 164 BCE. When they see the sanctuary desolate and the altar profaned, "they tore their clothes and mourned with great lamentation" (1 Maccabees 4:38-40). They cleanse the sanctuary, build a new altar, and on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month (Chislev), they offer sacrifice according to the law on the new altar of burnt offering (1 Maccabees 4:52-53). They celebrate for eight days "with gladness like that of the feast of booths" (1 Maccabees 4:56), and Judas and his brothers decree that this dedication should be observed annually—the origin of Hanukkah (1 Maccabees 4:59).

The book emphasizes God's deliverance through the Maccabees: "Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day" (1 Maccabees 4:25). However, it also notes that military success came specifically through Mattathias's family: when two other commanders, Joseph and Azariah, try to win glory independently, they are defeated "because they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel" (1 Maccabees 5:62).

Judas dies in battle in 161 BCE, and "all Israel made great lamentation for him... and said, 'How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!'" (1 Maccabees 9:20-21).

**Jonathan's Leadership (1 Maccabees 9-12)**: Jonathan, Judas's brother, assumes leadership and through diplomatic skill and military prowess continues the struggle. He eventually gains recognition from both Seleucid kings (who are fighting each other) and is appointed high priest in 152 BCE (1 Maccabees 10:20), even though he was not from the traditional Zadokite line. Jonathan is eventually captured and killed by the Seleucid general Trypho in 143 BCE (1 Maccabees 12:48).

**Simon's Leadership and Independence (1 Maccabees 13-16)**: Simon, the last surviving son of Mattathias, takes command. He negotiates full political independence for Judea in 142 BCE: "Thus the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel" (1 Maccabees 13:41). The people honor Simon's achievements with an official decree recognizing him as "high priest, commander and leader of the Jews" (1 Maccabees 14:41-47). This decree, carved on bronze tablets, establishes the Hasmonean dynasty's legitimacy.

Simon's reign brings peace and prosperity: "All the people sat under their own vines and fig trees, and there was none to make them afraid" (1 Maccabees 14:12). However, Simon and two of his sons are treacherously murdered by his son-in-law Ptolemy in 134 BCE (1 Maccabees 16:14-16). Simon's surviving son, John Hyrcanus, escapes and assumes leadership (1 Maccabees 16:23-24), where the book ends.

### 2 Maccabees: Theological Interpretation and Martyrdom

**Prefatory Letters and Introduction (2 Maccabees 1-2)**: The book opens with two letters from Jews in Jerusalem to Jews in Egypt, encouraging them to celebrate the festival commemorating the Temple's purification (2 Maccabees 1:1-2:18). The author then explains that he is abridging Jason of Cyrene's five-volume work (2 Maccabees 2:23).

**Heliodorus in the Temple (2 Maccabees 3)**: Unlike 1 Maccabees, which begins with Antiochus's persecution, 2 Maccabees starts earlier with the Seleucid official Heliodorus attempting to confiscate the Temple treasury in 178 BCE. The high priest Onias prays for divine intervention: "O Lord of all, who have need of nothing, you were pleased that there should be a temple for your habitation among us; so now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house that has been so recently purified forever undefiled" (2 Maccabees 3:36-37, NRSV). God responds by sending a magnificently arrayed horseman and two young men who beat Heliodorus, demonstrating God's direct protection of the Temple (2 Maccabees 3:24-26).

**Onset of Persecution (2 Maccabees 4-5)**: The crisis begins when Jason usurps the high priesthood and introduces Greek customs (2 Maccabees 4:7-17), followed by Menelaus's even greater wickedness. Antiochus IV then attacks Jerusalem, slaughtering many and desecrating the Temple (2 Maccabees 5:11-21). The author interprets this as divine punishment for the people's sins: the Lord "was not choosing the nation for the sake of the holy place, but the place for the sake of the nation. Therefore the place itself shared in the misfortunes that befell the nation and afterward participated in its benefits" (2 Maccabees 5:19-20).

**The Martyrdom of Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6)**: The persecution intensifies when Antiochus outlaws Jewish practices (2 Maccabees 6:1-11). Eleazar, a ninety-year-old scribe, is forced to eat pork. Friends suggest he secretly eat acceptable meat while pretending to comply, but Eleazar refuses: "Such pretense is not worthy of our time of life... Many of the young might suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year has gone over to an alien religion... Therefore by manfully giving up my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws" (2 Maccabees 6:24-28). As he dies, Eleazar declares: "The Lord in his holy knowledge knows that, though I might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these things because I fear him" (2 Maccabees 6:30).

**The Mother and Seven Sons (2 Maccabees 7)**: This chapter contains the most theologically significant martyrdom account. Seven brothers and their mother are tortured to death for refusing to eat pork. The second brother, as he is dying, declares the book's clearest affirmation of bodily resurrection: "You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws" (2 Maccabees 7:9).

The third brother, when asked for his hands and tongue to be cut off, boldly extends them saying: "I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again" (2 Maccabees 7:11)—a clear statement of belief in physical resurrection. The fourth brother affirms: "It is better, being put to death by mortals, to look to God for hope to be raised up again by him; but for you there will be no resurrection to life" (2 Maccabees 7:14), distinguishing between the resurrection of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked.

The mother, "filled with a noble spirit," encourages each son to accept martyrdom. In a theologically profound statement, she declares: "I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of humankind and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws" (2 Maccabees 7:22-23). This passage affirms God as Creator who will restore life to those who die for his laws.

**Judas's Victories and Temple Rededication (2 Maccabees 8-10)**: Judas Maccabeus and his followers call upon the Lord, praying: "O Lord, you sent your angel in the time of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he killed fully one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of Sennacherib. So now, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to spread terror and trembling before us" (2 Maccabees 8:19-20). They achieve victories and cleanse and rededicate the Temple, praying: "Lord, do not let this sanctuary be defiled forever, but shut the mouths of the Gentiles" (2 Maccabees 10:4, paraphrased).

**Prayers for the Dead (2 Maccabees 12)**: A crucial theological passage occurs when Judas discovers that slain Jewish soldiers were wearing pagan amulets. He takes up a collection and sends it to Jerusalem "to provide for a sin offering... for if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, so that they might be delivered from their sin" (2 Maccabees 12:43-45). This is the earliest clear statement of prayers and sacrifices for the dead being efficacious.

**Defeat of Nicanor (2 Maccabees 13-15)**: The book concludes with Judas's victory over the Seleucid general Nicanor in 161 BCE. Before battle, Judas has a vision of the deceased high priest Onias and the prophet Jeremiah interceding for the Jewish people and Jerusalem (2 Maccabees 15:12-16), demonstrating belief in the intercession of the departed saints.

### 3 Maccabees: Divine Deliverance in Egypt

**Ptolemy at the Temple (3 Maccabees 1-2)**: After defeating Antiochus III at the Battle of Raphia in 217 BCE, Ptolemy IV Philopator visits Jerusalem and wishes to enter the Holy of Holies. The high priest Simon explains that even Jewish priests from other families are forbidden to enter. Ptolemy insists, and Simon prostrates himself before the sanctuary and prays: "O Lord, Lord, King of the heavens, and sovereign of all creation, holy among the holy ones, the only ruler, almighty, give attention to us who are suffering grievously from an impious and profane man" (3 Maccabees 2:2).

God answers the prayer dramatically. When Ptolemy enters the outer courts and attempts to proceed further, "the Lord, who is all-powerful and almighty and true... struck him with a sudden and complete paralysis" (3 Maccabees 2:22). His companions carry him out, and he vows revenge on the Jews in Egypt.

**Persecution in Alexandria (3 Maccabees 3-4)**: Returning to Alexandria, Ptolemy decrees that all Jews must be registered, pay a poll tax, and be enslaved unless they agree to be initiated into the cult of Dionysus (3 Maccabees 2:27-33). Most Jews refuse, and Ptolemy orders them rounded up to be trampled by intoxicated elephants in the hippodrome (3 Maccabees 4:11).

**Divine Intervention (3 Maccabees 5-6)**: As the Jews await execution, the elderly priest Eleazar (not the same as in 2 Maccabees) offers a lengthy prayer: "O King of great power, Almighty God Most High, governing all creation with mercy, look upon the descendants of Abraham, O Father, upon the children of the sainted Jacob... Purify those who, suffering tribulation in a foreign land, were defiled through contagion with pollution" (3 Maccabees 6:2-3, 9).

God responds by sending two fearsome angels, visible only to Ptolemy and his forces, who terrify the elephants and cause them to trample the king's own army instead of the Jews (3 Maccabees 6:18-21). Ptolemy experiences a miraculous change of heart, releases the Jews, and grants them permission to kill their Jewish apostates (3 Maccabees 6:22-7:15). The Jews establish a seven-day festival to commemorate their deliverance (3 Maccabees 6:36).

### 4 Maccabees: Philosophical Discourse on Reason and Passion

**Philosophical Introduction (4 Maccabees 1-3)**: The book opens with its thesis: "The subject that I am about to discuss is most philosophical, that is, whether devout reason is sovereign over the emotions" (4 Maccabees 1:1). The author argues that reason guided by the fear of God and obedience to the Torah provides mastery over the four cardinal passions: desire, pleasure, fear, and pain (4 Maccabees 1:2-6).

The author uses examples from the Hebrew Bible, including Joseph's resistance to Potiphar's wife, Moses's meekness despite provocation, and David's refusal to drink water obtained at risk to his soldiers' lives, to demonstrate reason's mastery over emotions (4 Maccabees 2:1-3:18).

**Eleazar's Martyrdom Reinterpreted (4 Maccabees 5-7)**: The author retells Eleazar's martyrdom from 2 Maccabees but frames it as a philosophical demonstration. Antiochus attempts to persuade Eleazar through philosophical arguments to eat pork, arguing that nature provides all foods for human use and that it is foolish to reject them (4 Maccabees 5:8-9). Eleazar responds with sophisticated counter-arguments, asserting that the dietary laws teach self-control and train reason to govern the appetites (4 Maccabees 5:18-24).

As Eleazar endures torture, he demonstrates perfect rational control: "In this manner, through reason's discipline, he neither cried aloud nor groaned" (4 Maccabees 6:9-10). Before dying, Eleazar prays: "Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs" (4 Maccabees 6:29)—the book's clearest statement of vicarious, substitutionary atonement. His death demonstrates that "devout reason proves to be master over the emotions" (4 Maccabees 7:16).

**The Seven Brothers and Their Mother (4 Maccabees 8-17)**: The author then retells the martyrdom of the seven brothers and their mother, again emphasizing their rational choice to endure suffering rather than violate the law. Each brother delivers philosophical speeches demonstrating that their choice is reasonable given their belief in resurrection and divine judgment.

The mother's exhortation to her sons emphasizes reason over maternal emotions: "O reason of the children, tyrant over the emotions! O religion, more desirable to the mother than her children!" (4 Maccabees 15:1). She encouraged them by recalling how their father had taught them about faithful heroes like Abel, Isaac, Joseph in prison, Phinehas, Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, and Daniel (4 Maccabees 16:20-21). The author concludes that the martyrs' suffering brought atonement for the nation: "Through the blood of those devout ones and their death as an atoning sacrifice, divine Providence preserved Israel that previously had been mistreated" (4 Maccabees 17:22).

**Conclusion**: The four Books of Maccabees collectively present a comprehensive portrait of Jewish faithfulness under persecution—through historical chronicle (1 Maccabees), theological interpretation (2 Maccabees), didactic fiction (3 Maccabees), and philosophical discourse (4 Maccabees). While they contain limited direct divine speech, they powerfully emphasize God's providence, the authority of Torah, the reality of resurrection, the efficacy of prayer, and the power of faithful witness even unto death.

## Unique Teachings

The Books of Maccabees contain several theological and thematic teachings that are either unique to these books or receive their most explicit biblical development here. These distinctive doctrines have significantly influenced both Jewish and Christian theological reflection, though they remain points of contention between different religious traditions.

### 1. Explicit Bodily Resurrection of the Dead

While hints of resurrection appear elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (notably in Daniel 12:2 and Isaiah 26:19), **2 Maccabees provides the most explicit and detailed Old Testament teaching on bodily resurrection**. The book presents belief in personal resurrection from the dead with unprecedented clarity.

The martyred brothers make unambiguous resurrection declarations:
- "The King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws" (2 Maccabees 7:9)
- "I got these [hands] from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again" (2 Maccabees 7:11)
- "It is better, being put to death by mortals, to look to God for hope to be raised up again by him; but for you there will be no resurrection to life" (2 Maccabees 7:14)

Significantly, 2 Maccabees teaches **both physical resurrection and differential judgment**—the righteous will be resurrected to eternal life, while the wicked face eternal punishment without resurrection to life. This doctrine would become foundational to Christian theology but is stated here with greater clarity than anywhere else in the Old Testament.

The mother's theological reflection affirms God as Creator who will restore bodily life: "Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of humankind and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws" (2 Maccabees 7:22-23).

### 2. Prayers and Sacrifices for the Dead

**2 Maccabees 12:38-46** contains [the earliest statement of the doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees) that **prayers and sacrifices for the dead are efficacious**. This passage is unique in the entire Bible for its explicit endorsement of intercession for the deceased.

When Judas Maccabeus discovers that slain Jewish soldiers were wearing pagan amulets (an act forbidden by Torah), he takes up a collection amounting to two thousand drachmas of silver and sends it to Jerusalem "to provide for a sin offering" (2 Maccabees 12:43). The author explains the theological rationale: "For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, so that they might be delivered from their sin" (2 Maccabees 12:44-45).

This teaching implies **the possibility of postmortem purification or expiation** for otherwise righteous people who died with unrepented sins. The Catholic Church has based the doctrines of purgatory and masses for the dead on this passage, though Protestant interpreters note that this belief is "similar to, but not quite the same as, the Catholic doctrine of purgatory."

No other biblical book explicitly endorses prayers for the dead, making this a doctrinally unique contribution. Protestant traditions reject this teaching, while Catholic and Orthodox traditions embrace it as biblical warrant for their practices.

### 3. Intercession of Departed Saints

**2 Maccabees 15:11-16** contains a unique biblical account of **departed righteous persons interceding for the living**. Before the battle against Nicanor, Judas Maccabeus has a vision in which he sees:

- **Onias the former high priest** (who had been martyred), described as "a good and noble man... who prayed with outstretched hands for the whole body of the Jews"
- **The prophet Jeremiah** (long deceased), described as "a man gray-haired and dignified... distinguished by a wonderful and majestic air of authority"

Jeremiah gives Judas a golden sword, saying: "Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with which you will strike down your adversaries" (2 Maccabees 15:16).

This passage uniquely depicts **deceased saints actively interceding for God's people on earth**. Catholic and Orthodox traditions cite this as biblical support for the intercession of saints, while Protestant interpreters generally view it as non-canonical or as describing a vision rather than prescribing a doctrine.

### 4. Vicarious, Substitutionary Atonement Through Martyrdom

Both **2 Maccabees** and **4 Maccabees** uniquely develop the theology of **martyrdom as vicarious atonement** for the sins of the people. This concept appears nowhere else in the Old Testament with such clarity and theological sophistication.

**In 2 Maccabees**, the martyrs' deaths are portrayed as having redemptive efficacy. The story of Eleazar and the seven brothers demonstrates that their suffering has atoning value for the nation. While not as explicitly stated as in 4 Maccabees, the narrative implies that their faithfulness unto death helps turn away God's wrath from Israel.

**In 4 Maccabees**, this theology reaches full development. Eleazar prays as he dies: **"Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs"** (4 Maccabees 6:29). The author explicitly states that **"the suffering and martyrdom of the pious Maccabees is vicarious for the Jewish nation"** and that martyrdom brings **"atonement for the past sins of the Jews"** (4 Maccabees 17:22).

The text declares: **"Through the blood of those devout ones and their death as an atoning sacrifice, divine Providence preserved Israel that previously had been mistreated"** (4 Maccabees 17:22). This is the clearest Old Testament statement of substitutionary atonement—the idea that the suffering and death of the righteous has redemptive efficacy for others.

This theology profoundly influenced early Christianity's understanding of Jesus's death as an atoning sacrifice (cf. Mark 10:45, Romans 3:25, Hebrews 9:22-28). The concept that innocent suffering can atone for others' sins appears uniquely developed in 4 Maccabees.

### 5. Creation Ex Nihilo (Out of Nothing)

**2 Maccabees 7:28** contains one of the Bible's clearest statements of **creation ex nihilo** (out of nothing). The mother of the seven martyrs tells her youngest son:

> "I beseech you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being."

While Genesis 1 describes God creating, it does not explicitly state whether God created from pre-existing matter or from nothing. The Greek philosophical tradition debated whether matter was eternal or created. **2 Maccabees 7:28 uniquely affirms that God created everything from nothing**—a doctrine that became foundational to both Jewish and Christian theology.

This is the only explicit biblical statement of creation ex nihilo, making it theologically unique and significant.

### 6. Torah Observance as Rational Philosophy (Stoic-Jewish Synthesis)

**4 Maccabees** presents a unique synthesis of **Stoic philosophy with Jewish Torah observance**, arguing that the Law of Moses produces the very virtues that Greek philosophy values. This sophisticated apologetic appears nowhere else in biblical literature.

The book's thesis is that **"pious reason is sovereign over the emotions"** (4 Maccabees 1:1)—adapting the Stoic ideal that reason should master passions. However, the author argues that it is specifically **reason trained by Torah observance** that achieves this mastery.

Biblical laws are presented as practical means of Stoic self-education, classified according to the cardinal virtues they develop: wisdom, justice, courage, and self-control. The dietary laws, for instance, teach self-control over appetites (4 Maccabees 5:18-24). The martyrs demonstrate perfect rational self-mastery precisely because they have been trained by the Law.

This represents a **unique apologetic strategy**: rather than defending Judaism against Greek culture, 4 Maccabees argues that Judaism fulfills Greek philosophical ideals better than Greek philosophy itself. **Torah is presented as the supreme "philosophy"** that produces genuinely wise, virtuous, and rationally self-controlled individuals.

No other biblical book attempts this synthesis of Jewish revelation with Greek philosophy, making 4 Maccabees' approach distinctive.

### 7. Martyrdom as Rational Choice

Related to the above, **4 Maccabees uniquely presents martyrdom as a rational, philosophical decision** rather than an emotional or fanatical act. The martyrs calmly debate their captors, explaining why their choice to die rather than violate Torah is rational given God's promise of resurrection and rewards in the afterlife.

The mother is praised for acting "with a woman's reasoning and a man's courage" (4 Maccabees 15:30), and the martyrs' speeches emphasize logical argumentation. This transforms martyrdom from what might appear as irrational stubbornness into a carefully reasoned philosophical commitment—making it respectable in Greco-Roman cultural terms.

This rational approach to martyrdom is unique to 4 Maccabees and influenced both Jewish and Christian martyrological traditions.

### 8. Divine Providence in Diaspora Deliverance

**3 Maccabees** uniquely emphasizes **God's miraculous protection of diaspora Jewish communities** facing persecution in foreign lands. While other biblical books address diaspora life (Esther, Daniel), 3 Maccabees' emphasis on God sending angels to physically intervene and rescue Jews from execution in Egypt is distinctive.

The dramatic rescue through angelic intervention that turns the elephants against Ptolemy's own forces (3 Maccabees 6:18-21) emphasizes that **God's protection extends to Jews outside the Land of Israel**—an important theological affirmation for diaspora communities.

The book's emphasis on maintaining Jewish identity while remaining loyal subjects of foreign rulers (3 Maccabees 7:10-15) represents a unique approach to diaspora existence.

### 9. Hanukkah's Liturgical and Theological Foundations

Both **1 Maccabees** and **2 Maccabees** provide the **only biblical accounts of the events commemorated in Hanukkah**, the Festival of Dedication. While Hanukkah is mentioned in the New Testament (John 10:22), only the Maccabees books explain its origin:

- The Temple's defilement by Antiochus IV Epiphanes
- The Maccabean military victories
- The cleansing and rededication of the Temple
- The eight-day celebration modeled on Sukkot (1 Maccabees 4:52-59; 2 Maccabees 10:1-8)

The decree that this festival should be observed annually comes uniquely from these books (1 Maccabees 4:59). Without the Maccabees, the biblical tradition would contain no explanation for why Jesus observes the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem.

### 10. Martyrdom as Philosophical Demonstration

While martyrdom appears elsewhere in Scripture, **the use of martyrdom accounts as philosophical demonstrations of thesis propositions** is unique to 4 Maccabees. The book explicitly states: "I could prove to you from many and various examples that reason is dominant over the emotions, but I can demonstrate it best from the noble bravery of those who died for the sake of virtue" (4 Maccabees 1:7-8).

The martyrdom narratives function as **philosophical proofs** rather than merely as historical accounts or moral examples. This rhetorical and literary approach is unprecedented in biblical literature.

### Summary of Unique Teachings

The Books of Maccabees contribute several theologically significant teachings not found elsewhere in the Bible:

1. **Explicit bodily resurrection** with differential judgment (2 Maccabees)
2. **Prayers and sacrifices for the dead** (2 Maccabees)
3. **Intercession of departed saints** (2 Maccabees)
4. **Vicarious, substitutionary atonement** through martyrdom (2 & 4 Maccabees)
5. **Creation ex nihilo** (2 Maccabees)
6. **Torah as philosophical training** in Stoic virtues (4 Maccabees)
7. **Martyrdom as rational choice** (4 Maccabees)
8. **Divine protection of diaspora communities** (3 Maccabees)
9. **Hanukkah's origins and observance** (1 & 2 Maccabees)
10. **Martyrdom as philosophical demonstration** (4 Maccabees)

These teachings have profoundly influenced Jewish and Christian theology, though their canonical status remains disputed between traditions. Catholic and Orthodox Christians accept most of these teachings as biblical doctrine, while Protestant Christians generally regard them as historically and aologically interesting but not divinely authoritative.

## Textual Variants

The Books of Maccabees present interesting textual-critical questions involving lost Hebrew originals, multiple Greek manuscript traditions, and various ancient translations. Understanding the textual variants helps scholars reconstruct the original text and assess the reliability of different manuscript traditions.

### Lost Hebrew Original of 1 Maccabees

**The Problem of the Missing Hebrew**: [1 Maccabees was originally written in Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maccabees), as attested by both Origen and Jerome, who claimed to have seen Hebrew manuscripts. However, **no Hebrew text survives today**, and the work exists only in Greek translation preserved in the Septuagint.

The Greek text of 1 Maccabees has "the unmistakable style of a rather literal translation from the Hebrew," according to scholars. This translation character sometimes creates awkward Greek constructions that reflect Hebrew idioms and syntax. The loss of the Hebrew original means that scholars must work backward from the Greek to reconstruct what the Hebrew might have said, introducing some uncertainty into textual analysis.

**Why the Hebrew Was Lost**: As discussed in the Authorship section, the primary reason for the disappearance of the Hebrew version relates to the unpopularity of the Hasmonean dynasty in the centuries following the Maccabean Revolt. The Jewish community apparently did not preserve the Hebrew text, though diaspora Jews continued using the Greek translation in the Septuagint.

### Greek Manuscript Traditions

The Books of Maccabees are preserved in several major Greek manuscripts of the Septuagint, but not uniformly across all manuscripts:

**1 Maccabees** is extant in:
- **Codex Sinaiticus** (4th century) - includes 1 and 4 Maccabees, but NOT 2 or 3 Maccabees
- **Codex Alexandrinus** (5th century) - includes all four books of Maccabees (1, 2, 3, and 4)
- Notably **absent from Codex Vaticanus**, which lacks any of the books of Maccabees

**2 Maccabees** is found in:
- **Codex Alexandrinus** (5th century)
- **Codex Venetus** (8th century)
- Missing from **Codex Sinaiticus** (which includes 1 and 4 but not 2 or 3 Maccabees)
- Missing from **Codex Vaticanus**

**3 Maccabees** appears in:
- **Codex Alexandrinus**
- Missing from Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus

**4 Maccabees**:
- Included in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Alexandrinus
- Missing from Codex Vaticanus

This varying presence across major manuscripts reflects ancient debates about which books belonged in the biblical canon, with some manuscript traditions being more inclusive than others.

### Critical Editions

Modern critical editions attempt to reconstruct the best text from various manuscript witnesses:

**1 Maccabees**: **Werner Kappler** published a critical edition of the Greek text in 1936, creating an eclectic compilation of the various surviving manuscripts and attempting the best reconstruction of the original text. This edition forms the basis of most modern scholarly translations.

**2 Maccabees**: **Robert Hanhart** created a critical edition of the Greek text in 1959, with a second edition published in 1976. [Hanhart's edition is based mainly on Codex Alexandrinus](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees) and on minuscules 55, 347, and 771. There is also a rich tradition of Greek minuscule manuscripts, as well as manuscript witnesses to Syriac, Armenian, and Latin translations.

### The Lucianic Recension Problem

Ancient fragments of the Maccabees have been found, though some are attributed to **Lucian of Antioch** (c. 240-312 CE), who is considered to have "improved" some of his renditions with unknown other material, leading to variant readings. The Lucianic recension represents an early attempt to revise and harmonize the Greek text, but scholars debate which readings represent the original text versus Lucian's editorial improvements.

This creates challenges for textual critics: when a Lucianic manuscript differs from other traditions, is it preserving an earlier, more authentic reading, or is it introducing Lucian's "improvements"?

### Numerical Discrepancies in Army Sizes

The manuscript traditions show disagreements regarding numbers cited for sizes of armies. For example, different manuscripts give varying figures for:
- The size of Seleucid forces in various battles
- Numbers of casualties
- Amounts of tribute or plunder

These numerical variants may reflect:
- **Scribal errors** in copying large numbers (particularly easy when using Greek or Hebrew numerical systems)
- **Deliberate exaggeration** by authors or copyists to magnify victories
- **Different textual traditions** that preserved varying accounts

Not all manuscripts of 1 and 2 Maccabees agree on these numbers, and scholars must use textual-critical methods to determine which reading is more likely original.

### Original Language of 2 Maccabees

Unlike 1 Maccabees, **2 Maccabees was composed in Greek from the beginning**, with no evidence of an earlier Hebrew version. This means that the Greek manuscript tradition represents the original language, not a translation. This simplifies some textual-critical questions but raises others about which Greek manuscripts best preserve the original text.

### Ancient Versions and Translations

Various ancient translations preserve additional textual witnesses:

**Latin Vulgate**: Includes 1 and 2 Maccabees (translated by St. Jerome) but **not** 3 or 4 Maccabees. The Latin tradition represents an important early witness to the Greek text and sometimes preserves readings that differ from surviving Greek manuscripts.

**Syriac Peshitta**: The Peshitta Old Testament **omits or relegates to the end** several deuterocanonical books, including 1 and 2 Maccabees. This reflects the Syriac church's hesitation about the canonical status of these books.

**Armenian, Georgian, and Slavonic** translations: These Eastern Christian traditions preserve important witnesses to the Greek text, sometimes containing unique readings that help scholars reconstruct the original.

### Significant Textual Variants

While comprehensive listing of all variants would be extensive, some categories of significant variation include:

1. **Chronological data**: Variant dates for when certain events occurred
2. **Geographical names**: Different spellings or identifications of places
3. **Personal names**: Variations in how individuals are named
4. **Theological terminology**: Differences in how God is addressed or described (though these are relatively minor)
5. **Battle accounts**: Variations in descriptions of military engagements

None of these variants substantially change the theological message or historical narrative of the books, but they do affect details of reconstruction.

### Dead Sea Scrolls and Textual Traditions

While no fragments of the Books of Maccabees have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (likely because the Essene community that produced the scrolls opposed the Hasmonean dynasty), the Dead Sea Scrolls have illuminated general questions about textual traditions in the Second Temple period.

The scrolls have shown that **at the beginning of our era, there were several variant readings of Biblical texts**, and that different communities used different textual traditions. This contextualizes the variant traditions of the Maccabees books—textual plurality was the norm in Second Temple Judaism, not the exception.

### Scholarly Consensus

Despite the textual variants, scholars generally agree that:

1. The **overall narrative and theological message** of the books is well-preserved across manuscript traditions
2. **Major textual corruptions are rare**; most variants involve minor details
3. **Critical editions** by Kappler (1 Maccabees) and Hanhart (2 Maccabees) provide reliable reconstructions of the original Greek texts
4. The **lost Hebrew original of 1 Maccabees** can be partially reconstructed based on translation characteristics in the Greek

The textual tradition of the Maccabees books, while complex, is generally reliable and does not significantly hamper scholarly or devotional use of these texts.

## Textual Errors

Identifying "textual errors" in the Books of Maccabees requires distinguishing between (1) copyist errors in manuscript transmission, (2) historical inaccuracies in the original composition, and (3) theological or factual claims that conflict with other sources. Scholars approach these questions from both conservative and critical perspectives.

### 1. Chronological Problems

**Seleucid Era Dating System**: Both 1 and 2 Maccabees use the Seleucid Era for dating (beginning in 312/311 BCE), but scholars have identified some chronological inconsistencies:

- **1 Maccabees 1:54** dates the "abomination of desolation" to the 145th year of the Seleucid era (167 BCE), which most scholars accept as historically accurate.
- However, some dates in 1 Maccabees appear to conflict with dates given in 2 Maccabees for the same events, suggesting either different calendar systems or errors in one or both accounts.

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- **Conservative view**: The authors used different calendar systems (Macedonian vs. Jewish), which can reconcile most apparent discrepancies.
- **Critical view**: Minor chronological errors occurred during composition or transmission, understandable given the complexity of ancient dating systems.

### 2. Geographical Inconsistencies

**4 Maccabees' Jerusalem Geography**: As noted in the Authorship section, 4 Maccabees contains a **minor geographical mistake about the layout of Jerusalem**. The author appears unfamiliar with the precise topography of the city, suggesting diaspora composition rather than authorship by someone from Judea.

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- The author relied on secondhand knowledge or written sources rather than personal familiarity
- The geographical detail was not considered important for the book's philosophical purpose
- Scribal corruption may have altered an originally correct description

### 3. The Miracle of Hanukkah Oil

**The Talmudic Tradition vs. Maccabees**: The famous rabbinic tradition that a one-day supply of oil miraculously burned for eight days during the Temple rededication (b. Shabbat 21b) **does not appear in 1 or 2 Maccabees**. Instead, these books explain the eight-day celebration as modeled after the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), which the people had been unable to celebrate while in hiding (2 Maccabees 10:6).

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- **Historical view**: The oil miracle is a later rabbinic legend, not a historical fact; 1 and 2 Maccabees preserve the accurate historical reason (making up for missed Sukkot).
- **Harmonization attempt**: Both explanations could be true—the eight-day period commemorated Sukkot, while the oil miracle providentially confirmed the appropriateness of this length.
- **Theological development**: Rabbinic Judaism, uncomfortable with celebrating a military-political dynasty, reinterpreted Hanukkah as a miracle story emphasizing God's direct intervention rather than Hasmonean military prowess.

### 4. Numerical Exaggerations

**Army Sizes and Casualties**: Like many ancient historical works, the Maccabees books cite army sizes and casualty figures that scholars consider exaggerated:

- Antiochus IV's army is described in very large numbers
- Casualties in some battles seem impossibly high
- The amounts of tribute and plunder sometimes appear inflated

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- **Ancient convention**: Exaggeration of enemy forces and casualties was a standard feature of ancient military historiography, used to magnify victories
- **Symbolic numbers**: Some numbers may be symbolic or rhetorical rather than literal counting
- **Textual corruption**: Scribal errors in copying numbers could have inflated originally more modest figures
- **Conservative view**: Ancient armies were indeed massive, and modern skepticism underestimates the scale of ancient warfare

### 5. 3 Maccabees' Historical Accuracy

**The Ptolemy IV Persecution**: As discussed earlier, **no ancient source besides 3 Maccabees describes a persecution of Jews under Ptolemy IV Philopator**. Most scholars classify the book as **historical fiction or romance** rather than reliable history.

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- **Fiction view**: The author invented or heavily embellished the story for didactic purposes
- **Displaced history view**: The story may preserve distorted memories of a real persecution under **Ptolemy VIII Physcon** (146-117 BCE), where Josephus records Jews being executed by intoxicated elephants; the author transferred this incident to an earlier period and added fictitious elements
- **Minority historical view**: Some element of persecution under Ptolemy IV occurred but went unrecorded in other surviving sources

### 6. Theological "Errors" from Different Perspectives

**Doctrinal Conflicts**: Some teachings in the Maccabees books are considered "errors" from certain theological perspectives:

**Protestant view**:
- **Prayers for the dead** (2 Maccabees 12:42-46) contradicts sola scriptura and the sufficiency of Christ's atonement
- **Salvation through works and suffering** conflicts with salvation by faith alone
- **Intercession of saints** (2 Maccabees 15:11-16) is unbiblical

**Catholic/Orthodox response**:
- These are not errors but authentic apostolic teachings preserved in Scripture
- Protestant rejection reflects later theological developments, not original biblical teaching

**Jewish view**:
- The emphasis on bodily resurrection is problematic for some Jewish streams that emerged later
- The legitimization of the Hasmonean dynasty was eventually rejected by rabbinic Judaism

### 7. Contradictions Between 1 and 2 Maccabees

**Different Perspectives on the Same Events**: 1 and 2 Maccabees sometimes give conflicting accounts of the same events, suggesting at least one contains errors:

- **Judas Maccabeus's purification of the Temple**: Dated differently in the two accounts
- **Antiochus IV's death**: Described differently in terms of location and circumstances
- **Theological emphasis**: 1 Maccabees emphasizes military valor, while 2 Maccabees emphasizes martyrdom and divine intervention—these different emphases sometimes lead to different details

**Scholarly Explanations**:
- **Different sources**: The books drew on different eyewitness accounts or written sources
- **Different purposes**: 1 Maccabees (political legitimization) and 2 Maccabees (theological interpretation) shaped their narratives differently
- **Complementary accounts**: Like the Synoptic Gospels, different perspectives on the same events can provide fuller understanding without necessarily contradicting

### Scholarly Consensus

Most scholars, whether conservative or critical, agree:

1. **Minor errors exist** in details, particularly regarding chronology, geography, and numbers
2. **The overall historical framework is reliable**, especially in 1 Maccabees, which is considered one of the best historical sources for the period
3. **2 Maccabees is more theological than historical** in purpose and contains more legendary elements
4. **3 Maccabees is largely fictional**, though possibly based on displaced historical memories
5. **Textual errors** (copyist mistakes) are relatively minor and do not significantly affect interpretation

The question of whether theological teachings constitute "errors" depends entirely on one's canonical and theological commitments.

## Contradictions

The Books of Maccabees contain both internal contradictions (within and between the books) and apparent contradictions with other biblical texts. Understanding these requires careful attention to genre, purpose, and theological perspective.

### Internal Contradictions Within the Maccabees Books

#### 1. The Death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes

The most notable internal contradiction involves **different accounts of Antiochus IV's death**:

**1 Maccabees 6:1-16**: Antiochus dies in Persia (specifically in the city of Elymais/Ecbatana) after receiving news of Judas Maccabeus's victories. He becomes physically ill with grief and dies a relatively natural death, acknowledging his misdeeds against the Jews: "I remember the evils I did in Jerusalem... And I know that this is why these evils have overtaken me" (1 Maccabees 6:12-13).

**2 Maccabees 9:1-29**: Antiochus is struck down by God while traveling from Persia. He falls from his chariot, suffers horrible internal injuries, is consumed by worms, emits an unbearable stench, and dies in agony. The account emphasizes divine retribution: "The all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and invisible blow" (2 Maccabees 9:5). He reportedly writes a letter to the Jews seeking reconciliation before death.

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Different sources**: The authors drew on different traditions about Antiochus's death
- **Theological shaping**: 2 Maccabees shaped the account to emphasize divine judgment for persecuting the Jews, while 1 Maccabees gave a more straightforward report
- **Complementary accounts**: Both describe a death in the East involving illness and remorse, with 2 Maccabees providing more vivid (possibly embellished) details
- **Historical core with theological interpretation**: A historical death by illness was interpreted theologically in 2 Maccabees as divine punishment

#### 2. Dates of Key Events

**Temple Purification**: Different dating systems or interpretations lead to apparent contradictions in when events occurred:
- The two books sometimes date the same events to different months or years
- This may reflect use of different calendar systems (Macedonian vs. Babylonian/Jewish) or different starting points for the Seleucid Era

**Possible Explanations**:
- Different calendar systems account for most discrepancies
- Different methods of calculating regnal years
- Scribal errors in copying dates

#### 3. Emphasis on Martyrdom vs. Military Action

**1 Maccabees** appears **dismissive of passive martyrdom**, emphasizing bold military action. When others trust in non-violent resistance, they are slaughtered, and the book seems to view this as futile. The Maccabees' military prowess is glorified.

**2 Maccabees** **elevates martyrdom** as spiritually superior, devoting extensive narrative to Eleazar and the mother with seven sons who choose death over compromise. Their passive resistance is portrayed as heroic and theologically significant.

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Different theological perspectives**: 1 Maccabees reflects Hasmonean political propaganda valuing military action; 2 Maccabees reflects diaspora theological reflection valuing faithful witness
- **Different audiences**: Military victory resonates with Palestinian Jews seeking independence; martyrdom theology resonates with diaspora Jews under pressure to assimilate
- **Complementary witness**: Both military defense and faithful martyrdom have their place in Jewish resistance

### Contradictions Between Maccabees and Other Biblical Books

#### 1. Resurrection Theology vs. Earlier Old Testament Books

**2 Maccabees 7:9-14** teaches explicit bodily resurrection, but **most of the Old Testament** (including Torah, most prophets, and wisdom literature) contains at best only hints of afterlife, with Sheol described as a shadowy existence (Job 10:21-22, Psalm 6:5, Ecclesiastes 9:5).

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Progressive revelation**: God revealed resurrection doctrine gradually, with clearest revelation coming later (also seen in Daniel 12:2)
- **Development of tradition**: Jewish theology developed over time; 2 Maccabees reflects Second Temple period theological advances not present in earlier periods
- **Different theological streams**: Various Jewish groups held different views; 2 Maccabees represents one stream (Pharisaic) while other OT books represent others

#### 2. Prayers for the Dead vs. Earlier Scripture

**2 Maccabees 12:44-45** endorses prayers for the dead, but **no earlier biblical text** explicitly sanctions this practice. In fact, **Deuteronomy 18:10-12** forbids necromancy and communication with the dead.

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Catholic/Orthodox view**: Prayers for the dead are not communication with the dead (necromancy) but intercession to God on their behalf—a legitimate extension of biblical prayer principles
- **Protestant view**: This represents an illegitimate theological innovation not authorized by earlier revelation and contradicting the sufficiency of Christ's atonement
- **Historical development**: Reflects changing Jewish practice in the Second Temple period not found in earlier times

#### 3. Intercession of Deceased Saints vs. Earlier Teaching

**2 Maccabees 15:12-16** depicts deceased saints (Onias and Jeremiah) interceding for the living, but **earlier Scripture** emphasizes that God alone hears prayer and that the dead cannot interact with the living (Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, Isaiah 8:19).

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Vision interpretation**: This describes a visionary experience, not prescriptive doctrine; Judas sees departed saints in a vision, which doesn't necessarily mean regular intercession occurs
- **Catholic/Orthodox view**: The communion of saints transcends death; the righteous dead can intercede, fulfilling their ongoing role in God's people
- **Protestant view**: This contradicts the biblical pattern of prayer directed to God alone and Christ as sole mediator (1 Timothy 2:5)

#### 4. Hasmonean Legitimacy vs. Mosaic Law

**1 Maccabees** legitimizes the Hasmonean dynasty assuming the high priesthood, but **Mosaic Law** (Exodus 40:15, Numbers 25:13) reserves the high priesthood exclusively for **descendants of Aaron through the line of Zadok**. The Hasmoneans were Levites but not from the traditional high priestly line.

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Emergency circumstances**: Extraordinary situations require extraordinary measures; the legitimate line had been corrupted, necessitating Hasmonean intervention
- **Divine providence**: God raised up the Hasmoneans to deliver Israel, implicitly authorizing their priesthood
- **Political propaganda**: 1 Maccabees' legitimization reflects Hasmonean propaganda rather than authentic theological justification
- **Later Jewish rejection**: Rabbinic Judaism eventually rejected Hasmonean legitimacy, one reason the book was excluded from the Jewish canon

#### 5. Salvation Through Works and Suffering

**4 Maccabees** and **2 Maccabees** suggest that the martyrs' suffering and works of Torah obedience bring atonement and salvation, seemingly contradicting **Paul's teaching** that salvation comes through faith apart from works of law (Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16).

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Different covenantal contexts**: Old Covenant emphasized Torah obedience as the means of covenant faithfulness; New Covenant reveals salvation by grace through faith
- **Vicarious atonement vs. personal salvation**: The martyrs' death atones for the nation's sins (pointing forward to Christ), not their own individual salvation
- **Catholic/Orthodox view**: Works of love and obedience are essential to salvation, not contradicting grace but cooperating with it; Protestant sola fide represents a later deviation
- **Protestant view**: Maccabees' theology is pre-Christian and incomplete; Christ's revelation in the New Testament clarifies that salvation is by grace alone

### Contradictions with the Canonical Gospels and New Testament

#### 1. Feast of Dedication in John 10:22

**John 10:22** mentions Jesus observing Hanukkah (Feast of Dedication) in Jerusalem, implicitly validating the events commemorated. However, if these books contain historical errors, what is Jesus validating?

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Historical core**: The basic events (persecution, resistance, Temple rededication) are historically accurate even if details vary
- **Cultural practice**: Jesus participated in Jewish cultural festivals without necessarily endorsing every theological claim in the texts describing their origins
- **Validation of commemoration**: Jesus approved celebrating God's deliverance, not necessarily every detail in the Maccabean accounts

#### 2. Hebrews 11:35 Allusion to 2 Maccabees 7

**Hebrews 11:35** appears to allude to the martyrs in 2 Maccabees 7 as examples of faith, yet **Hebrews does not quote 2 Maccabees directly or call it Scripture**.

**Possible Explanations**:
- **Historical reference**: Hebrews acknowledges historical events without necessarily endorsing 2 Maccabees as canonical Scripture
- **Catholic view**: This demonstrates apostolic recognition of 2 Maccabees as inspired Scripture
- **Protestant view**: The NT can reference apocryphal books historically (as Paul quotes pagan poets, Acts 17:28) without affirming their canonical status

### Scholarly Approaches to Contradictions

**Conservative Harmonization**: Attempts to reconcile contradictions through:
- Different calendar systems
- Complementary perspectives on the same events
- Distinguishing between theological interpretation and historical core
- Understanding genre differences (history vs. theology vs. fiction)

**Critical Analysis**: Acknowledges real contradictions indicating:
- Multiple sources with conflicting traditions
- Theological shaping of historical material
- Legendary development over time
- Authors' different theological and political agendas

**Canonical Perspective**: Different Christian traditions resolve contradictions differently:
- **Catholic/Orthodox**: Accept 1-2 Maccabees as canonical, harmonize where possible, accept theological development
- **Protestant**: Reject canonical status, view contradictions as evidence for non-inspiration
- **Jewish**: Exclude all Maccabees from canon, view historical value but not divine authority

### Conclusion

The contradictions within and between the Books of Maccabees, while real, can be understood through:
1. **Different sources and traditions** informing the various books
2. **Different purposes** (political legitimization, theological reflection, diaspora encouragement, philosophical discourse)
3. **Different genres** (history, theological interpretation, didactic fiction, philosophical treatise)
4. **Progressive revelation** and theological development in Second Temple Judaism
5. **Varied canonical perspectives** among different religious traditions

Whether these contradictions undermine the books' authority depends entirely on one's view of their canonical status and the nature of scriptural inspiration.
