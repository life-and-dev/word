# Romans

## Authorship

The Epistle to the Romans is universally attributed to the Apostle Paul, and this represents one of the strongest cases of authorship attribution in the entire New Testament. Modern biblical scholarship maintains an overwhelming consensus that Paul authored Romans, with this letter being part of the core group of "undisputed Pauline epistles" that also includes 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon.

The letter explicitly identifies Paul as its author in the opening verse: "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God" ([Romans 1:1). Internal evidence strongly supports Pauline authorship, including the theological sophistication, the detailed knowledge of both Jewish and Gentile cultures, and the personal greetings to specific individuals in Rome that Paul would have known through his extensive travels.

The letter was dictated by Paul to his amanuensis (secretary) Tertius, who identifies himself in [Romans 16:22: "I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord." This practice of using a scribe was common in the ancient world and does not diminish Paul's authorship, as he would have directed the content and likely signed or added personal notes at the end.

External evidence for Pauline authorship is equally strong. Early church fathers unanimously attributed Romans to Paul, with no competing claims of authorship ever emerging. The letter was cited extensively by early Christian writers, and its authenticity has never been seriously questioned throughout church history, unlike some disputed epistles such as Hebrews or the Pastoral Epistles.

## Historical Environment

Romans was written during a pivotal period in both Roman history and early Christianity. Scholars date the composition to late 55 CE to early 57 CE, with the majority settling on late 56 or early 57 CE. Paul wrote the letter from Corinth, specifically while staying in the house of Gaius ([Romans 16:23), during his third missionary journey.

The political context was significant. Emperor Nero had recently ascended to the throne in 54 CE at the young age of 16, and the situation for Christians in Rome had not yet deteriorated to the point of active persecution that would come later in Nero's reign. However, the memory of Emperor Claudius's expulsion of Jews from Rome around 49 CE was still fresh. This edict, mentioned in Acts 18:2, was likely triggered by disturbances in the Jewish community related to debates about "Chrestus" (likely Christ), indicating early tensions between Jews and Jewish Christians.

The recipients of the letter were the Christian community in Rome, which consisted of both Jewish and Gentile believers. The composition of this community had likely shifted more toward Gentile dominance after Claudius's expulsion, and with Nero's accession and Claudius's death, Jewish believers (including Jewish Christians) were beginning to return to Rome. This created tensions about the role of Jewish law, circumcision, dietary restrictions, and the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in God's plan of salvation.

Paul himself had never visited Rome at the time of writing, though he had long desired to do so ([Romans 1:10-13, [Romans 15:22-24). He was preparing to travel to Jerusalem to deliver a collection from the Gentile churches for the poor believers there ([Romans 15:25-27), and he hoped to visit Rome on his way to Spain to expand his missionary work westward.

The cultural environment was one of religious pluralism and philosophical debate. Rome was the center of the empire, home to diverse religious traditions, Greek philosophical schools, and a significant Jewish diaspora community. This cosmopolitan setting required Paul to articulate the gospel in a way that would speak to both Jewish concerns about covenant faithfulness and Gentile questions about righteousness and moral living.

## Purpose

Paul's letter to the Romans serves multiple interconnected purposes, making it one of the most theologically comprehensive documents in the New Testament.

**Primary Theological Purpose:** Paul's overarching goal was to present a systematic exposition of the gospel and God's plan of salvation through Jesus Christ. He wanted to demonstrate that righteousness comes through faith in Christ alone, available to both Jews and Gentiles on equal terms. This message is encapsulated in the thesis statement of [Romans 1:16-17: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last."

**Practical Pastoral Purpose:** Paul aimed to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile believers in the Roman church. The debates about the continuing relevance of the Mosaic Law, dietary restrictions, observance of special days, and the relationship between the Old and New Covenants were threatening church unity. Paul's extensive treatment of these issues in chapters 9-11 and 14-15 demonstrates his concern for practical reconciliation and mutual acceptance within the body of Christ.

**Missionary Purpose:** Paul was preparing for his planned mission to Spain and hoped to use Rome as a base of operations for this western expansion ([Romans 15:24). He wanted to introduce himself and his theology to the Roman church, secure their support and partnership, and establish a relationship before his arrival. This explains why Romans is more formal and systematic than Paul's letters to churches he had founded.

**Defense and Clarification:** Paul's gospel of justification by faith apart from works of law had been misunderstood and misrepresented. He addresses potential objections throughout the letter (e.g., [Romans 3:8, [Romans 6:1, [Romans 6:15), suggesting he was aware of criticisms that his teaching encouraged antinomianism (lawlessness). Romans provided an opportunity to present a full, nuanced explanation of his theology that could not be easily caricatured.

**Theological Purpose Regarding Israel:** A significant portion of Romans (chapters 9-11) addresses the theological problem of Israel's relationship to God's promises. If the gospel is true and Jesus is the Messiah, why have most Jews rejected him? Has God's word failed? Paul needed to explain how God's faithfulness to Israel is maintained even as the gospel goes to the Gentiles, and to reveal the "mystery" that "all Israel will be saved" ([Romans 11:26).

## Cross-References

Romans is both deeply rooted in the Old Testament and highly influential on other New Testament writings, making it a crucial link in biblical theology.

**Old Testament Quotations and Allusions:** Romans contains approximately 74 explicit Old Testament quotations, making it one of the most OT-saturated books in the New Testament, second only to Hebrews and Revelation when allusions are included. Paul draws heavily from:

- **Genesis:** Abraham's faith and righteousness ([Romans 4:3 quotes Genesis 15:6)
- **Psalms:** Multiple quotations including Psalm 14:1-3 in [Romans 3:10-12, Psalm 32:1-2 in [Romans 4:7-8, and Psalm 19:4 in [Romans 10:18
- **Isaiah:** Extensively quoted in Romans 9-11 regarding Israel and the inclusion of Gentiles
- **Habakkuk:** "The righteous will live by faith" ([Romans 1:17 from Habakkuk 2:4)
- **Deuteronomy:** Paul quotes Deuteronomy 30:12-14 in [Romans 10:6-8 to explain the accessibility of the word of faith

Paul predominantly quotes from the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), which was widely used by diaspora Jews and early Christians. Studies indicate that of 263 Old Testament quotations in the New Testament, approximately 85 correspond specifically to the Septuagint translation, while others follow the Hebrew text or present unique variations.

**Influence on Other New Testament Books:**

- **James:** The relationship between James's teaching on faith and works (James 2:14-26) and Paul's teaching on justification by faith in Romans has generated extensive theological discussion. Both authors use Abraham as an example, though at different points in his life, and both quote Genesis 15:6, though with different emphases.

- **Hebrews:** The epistle to the Hebrews shares thematic connections with Romans, particularly regarding faith ([Hebrews 11 parallels Romans 4), access to God through Christ ([Hebrews 10:19-22 connects with [Romans 5:2), and the relationship between the Old and New Covenants.

- **1 Peter:** Peter's teaching about submission to governing authorities (1 Peter 2:13-17) parallels Paul's instructions in [Romans 13:1-7, suggesting either literary dependence or common early Christian teaching.

- **Early Church Fathers:** Justin Martyr (mid-2nd century) contains distinct references to Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians, demonstrating Romans' early and widespread influence in Christian theology.

**Theological Influence:** Romans has been arguably the most influential book in Christian theology after the Gospels. It was central to Augustine's conversion, served as the foundation for Luther's Reformation theology of justification, was pivotal in Wesley's evangelical awakening, and deeply influenced Calvin's systematic theology. The theological concepts articulated in Romans—original sin, justification, sanctification, election, and glorification—have shaped Christian doctrine for nearly two millennia.

## Canonical Status

The Epistle to the Romans has enjoyed universal acceptance in the Christian canon from the earliest periods of church history, with virtually no controversy over its inclusion in the New Testament.

**Early Acceptance and Attestation:** Romans appears in the earliest known collections of Paul's letters and is cited by church fathers from the late first century onward. Clement of Rome (writing circa 95-96 CE) appears to reference Romans in his epistle to the Corinthians. Ignatius of Antioch (circa 110 CE) shows knowledge of Pauline theology consistent with Romans, and by the time of Justin Martyr (mid-2nd century), there are distinct references to Romans alongside other Pauline epistles.

**Marcion's Canon:** Even the heretical teacher Marcion (circa 140 CE), who rejected the Old Testament and most of what would become the New Testament canon, included Romans in his heavily edited collection of ten Pauline epistles. However, Marcion removed large sections of Romans that he found objectionable, including [Romans 1:19-2:1, [Romans 3:21-4:25, most of Romans 9-11 (which emphasized God's faithfulness to Israel), and everything after [Romans 14:23. In Marcion's arrangement, Romans appeared fourth, after Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians.

Ironically, while Marcion's theology was condemned as heretical by the mainstream church, his attempt to create a definitive canon served as a catalyst for the orthodox church to formalize its own canonical list. The church's response was essentially: "These are the authentic apostolic writings, and they must be accepted in their complete, unedited form."

**Universal Canonical Acceptance:** By the time of the Muratorian Fragment (late 2nd century), one of the earliest surviving canonical lists, Romans was firmly established as authoritative Scripture. It appears in all major canonical lists from the 3rd and 4th centuries, including those of Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius (whose 39th Festal Letter of 367 CE is often cited as the first complete list of the 27-book New Testament canon), and the Councils of Hippo (393 CE) and Carthage (397 CE).

**Reasons for Acceptance:** Several factors contributed to Romans' universal acceptance:

1. **Apostolic Authorship:** The letter's claim to Pauline authorship was never seriously questioned, and Paul's status as an apostle gave it immediate authority.

2. **Theological Depth:** Romans' systematic presentation of Christian doctrine made it invaluable for teaching and defending the faith against heresies.

3. **Universal Message:** Unlike some of Paul's letters that addressed specific local controversies, Romans presented truths applicable to all Christians, making it relevant across different communities.

4. **Early Widespread Use:** The letter circulated widely from early times and was cited frequently by church fathers, demonstrating its universal acceptance and use in diverse Christian communities.

5. **Orthodox Theology:** Romans' teaching aligned with the theological consensus of the early church, particularly regarding Christology, soteriology, and the relationship between faith and works.

**Different Christian Traditions:** Romans is accepted in the canons of all major Christian traditions—Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Protestant. There are no canonical disputes about Romans among any Christian denomination.

The evidence-based reasons for Romans' canonical status rest on:
- Manuscript evidence (appearing in early papyri and all major codices)
- Patristic citations (quoted extensively by early church fathers)
- Theological consistency with apostolic teaching
- Universal acceptance across diverse geographical Christian communities
- Coherence with other canonical books

## Summary

The Epistle to the Romans represents Paul's most systematic and comprehensive presentation of Christian theology, structured as a logical argument that builds from the universal need for salvation to the glorious hope of believers.

**Introduction and Thesis (Romans 1:1-17):** Paul begins by identifying himself as "a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God" ([Romans 1:1). He explains that the gospel concerns God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, descended from David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection ([Romans 1:3-4). After expressing his desire to visit Rome and his obligation to preach to all people, Paul presents his thesis statement: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith'" ([Romans 1:16-17). This thesis—that God's righteousness is revealed and received through faith—governs the entire letter.

**Universal Sinfulness and God's Wrath (Romans 1:18-3:20):** Paul establishes that all humanity stands guilty before God. He begins by demonstrating that Gentiles are without excuse because "what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them" through creation ([Romans 1:19). Yet they suppressed this truth and exchanged the glory of God for idols ([Romans 1:23). As a result, "God gave them over" to sexual impurity, shameful lusts, and a depraved mind ([Romans 1:24, 26, 28). The inspired list of sins in [Romans 1:29-31 includes wickedness, evil, greed, depravity, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, God-hatred, insolence, arrogance, boastfulness, disobedience to parents, senselessness, faithlessness, heartlessness, and ruthlessness.

Paul then turns to those who judge others, particularly Jews who rely on the Law, declaring that God "will repay each person according to what they have done" ([Romans 2:6). God shows no favoritism ([Romans 2:11). Paul argues that possessing the Law is insufficient; "it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous" ([Romans 2:13). He introduces the concept that Gentiles who don't have the Law yet do by nature what the Law requires "show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts" ([Romans 2:15).

The devastating conclusion comes in [Romans 3:9-10: "What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one.'" Paul strings together multiple Old Testament quotations to prove universal sinfulness, concluding that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" ([Romans 3:23). The Law's purpose was not to save but to make people "conscious of their sin" ([Romans 3:20).

**Justification by Faith (Romans 3:21-5:21):** Having established universal guilt, Paul presents God's solution: "But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe" ([Romans 3:21-22). The critical theological teaching comes in [Romans 3:24-25: believers "are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith."

Paul declares God's purpose was "to demonstrate his righteousness" and "to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus" ([Romans 3:26). This eliminates all human boasting, for "we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" ([Romans 3:28).

Romans 4 extensively discusses Abraham as the paradigm of justification by faith. Paul quotes Genesis 15:6: "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness" ([Romans 4:3). This occurred before Abraham was circumcised, proving that justification doesn't depend on works or ritual observance. The righteousness was "credited"—imputed—to Abraham, not earned. Paul explains that "the words 'it was credited to him' were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead" ([Romans 4:23-24).

Romans 5 explores the benefits of justification: "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand" ([Romans 5:1-2). Paul celebrates that "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Romans 5:8). He then presents the theological concept of two representative heads of humanity: Adam, through whom "sin entered the world, and death through sin" ([Romans 5:12), and Christ, through whom "the gift of God is eternal life" ([Romans 5:15-21).

**Sanctification and Life in the Spirit (Romans 6:1-8:39):** Paul anticipates an objection: "Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?" His emphatic response: "By no means!" ([Romans 6:1-2). Believers have been united with Christ in baptism, dying to sin and rising to new life. The divine command is clear: "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God" ([Romans 6:12-13). Believers must "count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" ([Romans 6:11).

Romans 7 addresses the relationship between believers and the Law. Paul declares, "you also died to the law through the body of Christ" ([Romans 7:4). The Law itself is "holy, righteous and good" ([Romans 7:12), but it cannot empower obedience. Paul describes the internal struggle: "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do" ([Romans 7:15). He cries out, "What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?" ([Romans 7:24), answering immediately: "Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!" ([Romans 7:25).

Romans 8 is one of the most theologically rich chapters in Scripture. It begins with the proclamation: "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death" ([Romans 8:1-2). God accomplished what the Law could not: "By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit" ([Romans 8:3-4).

Paul teaches that "those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God" ([Romans 8:14), and "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children" ([Romans 8:16). The Spirit helps believers in their weakness, for "the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God" ([Romans 8:27).

God's sovereign purpose is revealed: "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son" ([Romans 8:28-29). The famous "golden chain of salvation" follows: "And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified" ([Romans 8:30).

The chapter culminates in one of the most confident declarations in Scripture: "If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?" ([Romans 8:31-32). Paul concludes with the assurance that absolutely nothing "will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" ([Romans 8:39).

**God's Plan for Israel (Romans 9:1-11:36):** These three chapters address the theological problem of Israel's relationship to God's promises. Paul expresses profound anguish: "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people" ([Romans 9:2-3). He recounts Israel's privileges: theirs are the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the law, the temple worship, the promises, and the patriarchs—and from them comes the Christ ([Romans 9:4-5).

Paul asserts God's sovereign right in election: "It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy" ([Romans 9:16). Using the analogy of a potter and clay, he teaches that God has the right "to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use" ([Romans 9:21). Yet Paul also emphasizes human responsibility: Israel "pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works" ([Romans 9:32).

In Romans 10, Paul explains that "Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes" ([Romans 10:4). The gospel is accessible: "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" ([Romans 10:9). The profound teaching follows: "For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved'" ([Romans 10:12-13).

Romans 11 reveals hope for Israel's future. Paul asks, "Did God reject his people? By no means!" ([Romans 11:1). He teaches that "Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way all Israel will be saved" ([Romans 11:25-26). This is described as a "mystery"—a divine truth previously hidden but now revealed. Paul warns Gentile believers against arrogance, using the metaphor of branches grafted into an olive tree ([Romans 11:17-24). The section concludes with a doxology praising God's wisdom: "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!" ([Romans 11:33).

**Practical Christian Living (Romans 12:1-15:13):** Having laid the theological foundation, Paul turns to practical application. He appeals: "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind" ([Romans 12:1-2). This represents the proper response to God's mercies outlined in chapters 1-11.

Paul instructs believers about using spiritual gifts in humility ([Romans 12:3-8), practicing sincere love ([Romans 12:9-13), and responding to persecution: "Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse" ([Romans 12:14). He commands: "Do not repay anyone evil for evil" and "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" ([Romans 12:17-18). Vengeance belongs to God alone ([Romans 12:19). Instead, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink" ([Romans 12:20).

Romans 13 includes God's teaching about governing authorities: "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God" ([Romans 13:1). Rulers are "God's servant to do you good" and "an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer" ([Romans 13:4). Paul commands payment of taxes and respect to authorities ([Romans 13:7).

Love fulfills the law's requirements: "Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law" ([Romans 13:8). The commandments are "summed up in this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself'" ([Romans 13:9). Paul urges readiness for Christ's return: "The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light" ([Romans 13:11-12).

Romans 14-15 address tensions between "weak" and "strong" believers regarding dietary restrictions and observance of special days. Paul teaches mutual acceptance: "Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters" ([Romans 14:1). The key principle: "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" ([Romans 14:17). Believers should "stop passing judgment on one another" ([Romans 14:13) and instead pursue "what leads to peace and to mutual edification" ([Romans 14:19). Paul's rule: "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" ([Romans 14:23).

**Personal Plans and Greetings (Romans 15:14-16:27):** Paul explains his missionary strategy and his desire to visit Rome on his way to Spain ([Romans 15:22-24). He describes his ministry in priestly terms: "to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit" ([Romans 15:16). He requests prayer for his upcoming visit to Jerusalem ([Romans 15:30-32).

Romans 16 contains extensive personal greetings to at least 26 individuals, demonstrating Paul's pastoral care and the interconnectedness of early Christian communities. He commends Phoebe, "a deacon of the church in Cenchreae" ([Romans 16:1), greets Priscilla and Aquila as "my co-workers in Christ Jesus" who "risked their lives for me" ([Romans 16:3-4), and mentions numerous other believers including Epenetus, Mary, Andronicus and Junia (notable apostles), Ampliatus, Urbanus, Stachys, Apelles, and many others.

Paul warns against those "who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned" ([Romans 16:17). He assures them: "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" ([Romans 16:20). The letter concludes with a doxology: "Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith—to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen" ([Romans 16:25-27).

## Unique Teachings

Romans contains several theological concepts that are either unique to this epistle or receive their most complete and systematic treatment here:

**1. Imputation of Righteousness:** While justification by faith appears in other Pauline letters, Romans provides the most detailed explanation of the doctrine of imputed righteousness. The concept that righteousness is "credited" or "reckoned" to believers (Greek: logizomai) appears repeatedly in Romans 4, explaining that God counts believers as righteous based on Christ's righteousness rather than their own works. This forensic or legal declaration distinguishes Christian justification from moral improvement or earned merit.

**2. Adam-Christ Typology:** Romans 5:12-21 presents the unique theological framework of two representative heads of humanity. This "Federal Headship" theology—where Adam represents fallen humanity and Christ represents redeemed humanity—is found only in Romans and 1 Corinthians 15:22, 45-49, with Romans providing the more extensive treatment. The parallel shows how "just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people" ([Romans 5:18).

**3. The Struggle of Romans 7:** The description of the internal moral struggle in [Romans 7:14-25 is unique in Scripture. While debate exists about whether Paul describes pre-conversion experience, post-conversion sanctification struggle, or human experience under Law, this passage uniquely articulates the conflict between knowing what is right and being unable to consistently do it: "I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out" ([Romans 7:18).

**4. The Mystery of Israel's Future Salvation:** Romans 9-11 presents teachings about Israel's hardening and future restoration that are unique in the New Testament. The concept that "all Israel will be saved" ([Romans 11:26) after "the full number of the Gentiles has come in" ([Romans 11:25) is explicitly called a "mystery"—previously hidden divine truth now revealed. This extended theological reflection on ethnic Israel's place in God's redemptive plan is unparalleled in the New Testament.

**5. The Olive Tree Metaphor:** The imagery in [Romans 11:17-24 of natural branches (ethnic Israel) broken off and wild branches (Gentiles) grafted into the cultivated olive tree (the people of God) is unique to Romans. This metaphor explains the relationship between Jewish and Gentile believers and warns against Gentile arrogance while maintaining hope for Israel's re-grafting.

**6. The Golden Chain of Redemption:** The sequence in [Romans 8:29-30 linking foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justification, and glorification presents the complete scope of God's salvific work in a way not found elsewhere. This "ordo salutis" (order of salvation) has been foundational for systematic theology.

**7. Creation's Groaning and Hope:** Romans 8:19-23 uniquely describes the entire created order as "subjected to frustration" yet waiting in "eager expectation" for liberation. The teaching that "the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay" ([Romans 8:21) presents a cosmic scope to redemption not articulated elsewhere in Scripture.

**8. Weak and Strong in Faith:** While Paul addresses specific issues (food, days) in Romans 14-15 similar to 1 Corinthians 8-10, Romans uniquely presents the broader principle that in matters of Christian liberty, "each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind" ([Romans 14:5) and that "whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God" ([Romans 14:22). The emphasis on conscience and conviction in non-essential matters receives its fullest treatment here.

**9. The Righteousness of God (Theodicy):** While other books discuss God's righteousness, Romans uniquely presents a comprehensive theodicy showing how God remains righteous while justifying the ungodly. Paul addresses how God can be both just and the justifier ([Romans 3:26), maintaining divine justice while exercising mercy.

## Textual Variants

Romans, like all ancient texts, has been transmitted through numerous manuscript copies, resulting in textual variants. While most variants are minor (spelling differences, word order), several significant variants warrant discussion:

**1. The Doxology Placement (Romans 16:25-27):** This is the most significant textual issue in Romans. The doxology appears in different locations across the manuscript tradition:
- After [Romans 16:23 (majority of manuscripts, including Alexandrinus and Byzantine text)
- After [Romans 14:23 (some Byzantine manuscripts)
- After both chapters 14 and 16 (some manuscripts include it twice)
- After [Romans 15:33 (Papyrus 46, circa 200 CE)
- Omitted entirely (some early witnesses)

Papyrus 46 is particularly significant as one of the oldest witnesses to Romans. The UBS Greek New Testament places the doxology at the end of chapter 16, which most scholars consider the original location, with the variants explained by Marcion's truncated version that ended at chapter 14.

**2. Romans 16:24:** This verse, reading "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen," is absent from major early Greek manuscripts including Papyrus 46, Papyrus 61, Codex Sinaiticus (א), Codex Alexandrinus (A), Codex Vaticanus (B), Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), and others. The UBS4 rates its omission as "certain" (A-level confidence). This verse appears to be a scribal addition, perhaps copied from similar benedictions in other Pauline letters. Most modern translations either omit it or include it in brackets with a note.

**3. Romans 5:1 - "We have peace" vs. "Let us have peace":** This variant involves a single letter in Greek—echomen (we have) versus echōmen (let us have). The difference is between the indicative mood (stating a fact: "we have peace with God") and the subjunctive/hortatory mood (making an exhortation: "let us have peace with God"). Manuscript evidence is divided, but the majority of scholars prefer the indicative reading based on:
- Better manuscript support (P46, Codex Sinaiticus original hand, Codex Vaticanus)
- Better contextual fit (Paul is describing benefits of justification, not exhorting)
- Transcriptional probability (scribes might change indicative to hortatory to create an exhortation)

**4. Romans 1:1 - "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ" vs. "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus":** While this variation in word order doesn't significantly affect meaning, it demonstrates how minor variations occur. The manuscripts are divided between "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus," with both readings having ancient support.

**5. Romans 1:7 - "in Rome":** One manuscript (Codex Boernerianus, 9th century) omits the words "in Rome," simply reading "To all God's beloved…called to be saints." Some scholars suggest this reflects a version of Romans circulated as a general epistle, though the overwhelming manuscript evidence supports inclusion of "in Rome."

**6. Romans 8:2 - "me" vs. "you":** Some manuscripts read "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free" while others read "has set you free." The first person "me" has stronger manuscript support and fits Paul's argument better, though some later manuscripts harmonized it to second person to make it more directly applicable to readers.

**7. Romans 13:9 - Inclusion of "Do not covet":** Most manuscripts include "do not covet" in the list of commandments, but some omit it. The inclusion has strong manuscript support and is retained in modern translations.

**8. Old Testament Quotations - LXX vs. Hebrew Text Variants:** Paul quotes the Old Testament extensively in Romans, usually following the Septuagint (Greek translation). Sometimes Paul's quotations differ from both the Masoretic (Hebrew) text and the standard Septuagint, suggesting either:
- Paul used a different Septuagint manuscript tradition
- Paul translated directly from Hebrew with interpretive freedom
- Paul adapted quotations for his theological argument
- The Septuagint Paul used reflected a different Hebrew source text (as Dead Sea Scrolls have shown)

Example: In [Romans 10:18, Paul quotes Psalm 19:4 according to the Septuagint ("Their voice has gone out into all the earth"), which differs from the Masoretic Hebrew ("Their measuring line goes out through all the earth"). This illustrates the textual complexity when the New Testament quotes the Old Testament.

**Scholarly Consensus:** Despite these variants, scholars emphasize that none affect core Christian doctrines. The New Testament text, including Romans, is among the best-attested ancient documents, with thousands of manuscripts providing a solid basis for reconstructing the original text. Modern critical editions like the UBS5 and NA28 carefully note variants and rate their confidence in the original reading.

## Textual Errors

While "textual errors" often refers to scribal mistakes in manuscript transmission (covered above in Textual Variants), this section addresses alleged historical, factual, or internal inconsistencies that scholars have identified or debated within Romans itself.

**1. Paul's Use of Old Testament Quotations:** Critics note that Paul sometimes appears to use Old Testament passages in ways that differ from their original context. For example:

- **Romans 10:18 and Psalm 19:4:** Paul quotes Psalm 19:4 ("Their voice has gone out into all the earth") to suggest the gospel had been preached everywhere, but the original Psalm refers to the heavens declaring God's glory, not gospel preaching.

*Conservative explanation:* Paul employs typological or analogical reasoning—if general revelation through creation reaches everywhere (Psalm 19), how much more should special revelation through preaching. Alternatively, Paul uses a "how much more" (qal vahomer) argument: if the heavens' witness reaches all, surely the gospel can too. Paul isn't claiming the original Psalm referred to gospel preaching but drawing a parallel.

*Critical explanation:* Paul engages in creative midrashic interpretation common in Second Temple Judaism, where texts were applied to new situations regardless of original context. This reflects ancient interpretive methods, not modern historical-critical exegesis.

**2. Adam as Historical Figure:** Paul's theology in Romans 5:12-21 depends on Adam as the first human through whom sin and death entered the world. Modern evolutionary biology challenges a historical Adam, creating tension with Paul's argument.

*Conservative explanation:* Recent scholarship proposes various models reconciling a historical Adam with evolutionary science, including: (1) Adam as a specially chosen representative from an existing hominin population; (2) Adam as the first hominid given a soul/divine image; (3) archetypal reading where Adam represents all humanity without requiring sole genetic ancestry. The theological point—humanity's universal sinfulness and need for redemption—remains valid regardless.

*Critical explanation:* Paul reflects first-century Jewish understanding of Genesis as straightforward history. His theological argument depends on a premise (historical Adam) that may be incorrect, suggesting his reasoning is culturally conditioned rather than divinely revealed truth.

**3. Romans 13:1-7 and Political Authority:** Paul's teaching to "submit to governing authorities" has been criticized as problematic given historical context—Nero was emperor when Paul wrote this, and Nero later severely persecuted Christians. The teaching seems to absolutize government authority without qualification.

*Conservative explanation:* Paul writes before Nero's persecution intensified (circa 64-68 CE). His teaching addresses the proper Christian stance toward legitimate governmental functions (maintaining order, punishing wrongdoing, collecting taxes) rather than commanding absolute obedience to tyranny. Other Scriptures balance this (Acts 5:29: "We must obey God rather than human beings"). Paul himself was imprisoned multiple times, showing he didn't advocate blind submission. The passage forbids revolutionary anarchy, not justified resistance to manifest evil. Romans 13:4 specifies rulers should be "God's servant to do you good"—when they become agents of evil, the premise changes.

*Critical explanation:* Paul's conservative political stance reflects his eschatological expectation that Christ would return soon, making political revolution pointless. Later generations without this imminent expectation found his teaching inadequate for addressing systemic injustice.

**4. Romans 9 and Divine Justice:** Paul's teaching on election and predestination—particularly "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" ([Romans 9:13) and God hardening Pharaoh's heart—raises questions about divine justice and human free will. Paul anticipates the objection: "Why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?" ([Romans 9:19).

*Conservative explanations vary:*
- **Reformed view:** God's sovereign choice glorifies His mercy toward the elect and justice toward the reprobate. Humans have no claim on God's mercy; all deserve judgment. Election is purely gracious.
- **Corporate election view:** Paul discusses nations (Israel/Edom, ethnic groups) and their roles in redemptive history, not individual eternal destinies. God chose Israel for a historical mission, not individual Jews for automatic salvation.
- **Prescient view:** God's "foreknowledge" ([Romans 8:29) means He elects based on foreseen faith, though this view has difficulty with "not by works" emphasis.

*Critical explanation:* Paul presents an unresolved tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility, common in Jewish theology. His potter-clay analogy ([Romans 9:21) doesn't fully answer the objection he raises, suggesting Paul himself struggled with this paradox.

**5. Chronological Issues in Paul's Biography:** Some scholars note that reconstructing Paul's life from Acts and his letters (including references in Romans) creates chronological difficulties. Romans 15:19 claims Paul preached "from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum," but Acts doesn't record ministry in Illyricum (modern Albania/Croatia).

*Conservative explanation:* Acts is selective, not exhaustive. Luke focuses on significant events and doesn't record every location Paul visited. Paul may have briefly evangelized Illyricum during travels Acts summarizes briefly. Alternatively, "as far as Illyricum" may mean Paul preached up to the border region without extensive ministry there.

*Critical explanation:* Acts and Paul's letters represent different traditions with some historical discrepancies, reflecting that ancient biographies weren't concerned with modern standards of precision.

**6. The Logic of Romans 2:13-16:** Paul states that "it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous" ([Romans 2:13) and suggests Gentiles who "do by nature things required by the law" show "the requirements of the law are written on their hearts" ([Romans 2:14-15). This seems to contradict his later argument that "no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law" ([Romans 3:20).

*Conservative explanations:*
- Paul presents a hypothetical in chapter 2: *if* someone perfectly obeyed, they would be righteous, but chapter 3 shows no one does this.
- The Gentiles in 2:14-15 are Christian converts who, empowered by the Spirit, fulfill the law's requirements (cf. [Romans 8:4).
- Paul addresses Jewish presumption: possessing the Law doesn't save; only doing it would—but since all fail, all need grace.

*Critical explanation:* Paul's argument in chapters 2-3 contains genuine tension, reflecting his attempt to affirm both universal guilt and God's impartial judgment.

**Scholarly Consensus:** Conservative scholars emphasize that apparent difficulties often result from imposing modern expectations on ancient texts or failing to appreciate Paul's rhetorical strategy and Jewish interpretive methods. Critical scholars see these issues as evidence of human authorship wrestling with complex theological questions, reflecting cultural conditioning alongside theological insight.

## Contradictions

Several apparent contradictions exist both within Romans and between Romans and other biblical books. Scholars have proposed various resolutions to these tensions.

**1. Faith vs. Works: Romans and James**

**The Contradiction:**
- Paul: "We maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" ([Romans 3:28)
- James: "You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone" (James 2:24)

This seeming contradiction was central to the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther famously called James a "right strawy epistle" because of this tension.

**Proposed Resolutions:**

*1. Different definitions of key terms:*
- Paul's "works of the law" refers to Jewish ceremonial laws (circumcision, dietary restrictions, Sabbath) that marked Jewish identity, while James's "works" refers to ethical deeds demonstrating living faith.
- Paul's "faith" means genuine trust in Christ, while James opposes mere intellectual assent ("even the demons believe," James 2:19).

*2. Different opponents and contexts:*
- Paul opposed legalists who taught Gentiles must become Jews to be saved, so he emphasized faith over boundary markers.
- James opposed antinomians who claimed faith without moral transformation, so he emphasized that genuine faith produces works.

*3. Different points in Abraham's life:*
- Paul cites Genesis 15:6 (Abraham's initial faith before circumcision, early in his life)
- James cites Genesis 22 (Abraham's offering of Isaac, decades later, demonstrating matured faith)

*4. Different kinds of justification:*
- Paul discusses initial justification before God (forensic declaration)
- James discusses vindication/demonstration before people (showing faith is real)

*5. Complementary emphases:*
- Paul: Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone (it produces works)
- James: Works don't earn salvation, but they necessarily flow from saving faith
- Both affirm that saving faith transforms behavior

**Theological Synthesis:** When Paul says we're justified apart from works, he means the *basis* of justification is Christ's work, not ours; we receive it by faith, not by earning it. When James says we're not justified by faith alone, he means genuine justifying faith will *necessarily produce* good works as evidence; faith without works is dead, demonstrating it wasn't real faith. They attack different errors from different angles but teach complementary truths.

**2. Law Observance: Positive and Negative**

**The Contradiction:**
- Positive: "Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law" ([Romans 3:31)
- Positive: "The righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us" ([Romans 8:4)
- Negative: "You also died to the law through the body of Christ" ([Romans 7:4)
- Negative: "You are not under the law, but under grace" ([Romans 6:14)

**Proposed Resolutions:**

*1. Different aspects of the Law:*
- The Law's moral demands (love God, love neighbor) remain valid and are fulfilled through the Spirit
- The Law's function as a covenant system for relating to God is ended (ceremonial and civil aspects)
- The Law as a condemning system is abolished for believers in Christ

*2. Different relationships to the Law:*
- Believers are freed from the Law as a means of justification (earning righteousness)
- Believers are freed from the Law's condemnation (penalty for failure)
- Believers uphold the Law's moral intent through Spirit-empowered obedience

*3. Christ fulfills the Law:*
- Jesus perfectly fulfilled the Law's demands
- His righteousness is credited to believers
- The Spirit writes the Law on believers' hearts (New Covenant promise, Jeremiah 31:33)

*4. Terminological precision:*
- "Under law" (hypo nomon) refers to being in a law-covenant relationship where law-keeping determines standing
- "Upholding law" refers to affirming its divine origin and moral validity
- "Fulfilling law" ([Romans 13:8-10) means achieving its purpose (love) through grace

**Theological Synthesis:** Believers are freed from the Law as a system of earning righteousness or as a covenant defining their relationship with God, but they uphold the Law's moral teaching and, empowered by the Spirit, fulfill its righteous requirements through love. The Law's function changed from condemnation to vindication, from external code to internal transformation.

**3. Election and Human Responsibility**

**The Contradiction:**
Within Romans itself, Paul affirms both divine sovereignty and human responsibility:
- Sovereignty: "It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy" ([Romans 9:16)
- Sovereignty: "God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden" ([Romans 9:18)
- Responsibility: "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved" ([Romans 10:13)
- Responsibility: Israel's unbelief is blamed on them: "they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works" ([Romans 9:32)

**Proposed Resolutions:**

*1. Both are true (paradox/mystery):*
- Reformed theology affirms "compatibilism"—God's sovereignty and human responsibility are both fully true, though we cannot fully comprehend how
- God ordains both ends and means; He decrees salvation and also decrees faith as the means
- Paul presents both without full philosophical resolution because both are biblically revealed

*2. Different perspectives:*
- From God's eternal perspective: He sovereignly elects
- From human experiential perspective: We choose and are responsible
- These are not contradictory but complementary viewpoints

*3. Corporate vs. individual election:*
- Romans 9 discusses corporate election (God chose Israel as a nation for historical purposes)
- Romans 10 discusses individual response (anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved)
- God determines the plan; individuals determine their place in it

*4. Hardening as judicial response:*
- God's "hardening" ([Romans 9:18) is judicial response to prior rejection, not arbitrary determination
- God hardens those who first harden themselves (as Pharaoh did, Exodus 7-14)
- This preserves human responsibility while affirming God's sovereignty

*5. Foreknowledge interpretation:*
- "Those God foreknew he also predestined" ([Romans 8:29)
- Some interpret "foreknew" as foreseen faith (God predestined those He knew would believe)
- Others interpret "foreknew" as relational (God set His love on them beforehand)

**Theological Synthesis:** Paul presents both truths forcefully without attempting philosophical harmonization. Different theological traditions emphasize one aspect more strongly (Reformed emphasizing sovereignty, Arminian emphasizing free will, Molinist proposing middle knowledge), but Paul's primary concern is pastoral: humbling human pride (we can't save ourselves) while maintaining hope (all who call on the Lord will be saved).

**4. Universal Salvation Language**

**The Contradiction:**
Romans contains both universalistic language and particularistic language:

- Universal-sounding: "As one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people" ([Romans 5:18)
- Universal-sounding: "God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all" ([Romans 11:32)
- Particularistic: "Those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified" ([Romans 8:30) - implying a limited group
- Particularistic: Salvation comes only to "everyone who believes" ([Romans 1:16, [Romans 10:4)

**Proposed Resolutions:**

*1. "All" means "all kinds/types" (Jews and Gentiles):*
- The primary "all" contrast in Romans is ethnic (Jews and Gentiles), not individual (every single person)
- "All have sinned" ([Romans 3:23) and "all who believe" are saved means no ethnic restriction

*2. Provision vs. application:*
- Christ's work is sufficient for all (universal provision)
- But it's efficient only for those who believe (limited application)
- The "all" in [Romans 5:18 refers to potential scope, not actual result

*3. Parallel structure in Romans 5:*
- Just as "all" died because of Adam (universal effect of the first Adam), so "all" who are in Christ receive life
- The "all" is qualified by being "in" the respective head (Adam or Christ)

*4. Progressive revelation in Romans:*
- Early chapters use broad language about God's desire for all
- Later chapters clarify that salvation requires response (faith, calling on the Lord)
- The progression shows God's universal offer requires particular response

**Theological Synthesis:** God's salvific work in Christ is objectively sufficient for all humanity and subjectively offered to all, but it becomes effective for those who respond in faith. Paul's "all" language emphasizes the removal of ethnic barriers (Jew/Gentile), not the automatic salvation of every individual regardless of faith.

**5. Romans and Gospels on Gentile Inclusion**

**The Tension:**
- Jesus's earthly ministry focused on "the lost sheep of Israel" (Matthew 15:24)
- Jesus told disciples, "Do not go among the Gentiles" (Matthew 10:5)
- Paul emphasizes Gentile inclusion as central to the gospel, even calling it a "mystery" ([Romans 16:25-26)

**Proposed Resolutions:**

*1. Progressive revelation:*
- Jesus's earthly ministry fulfilled Israel-first priority ("to the Jew first, then the Gentile," [Romans 1:16)
- After resurrection, Jesus commissioned worldwide mission (Matthew 28:19)
- Paul received specific revelation about the mystery of Gentile inclusion ([Ephesians 3:6)

*2. Prophetic fulfillment:*
- Old Testament prophesied Gentile inclusion (Isaiah, Amos, etc.)
- Jesus's ministry prepared Israel as a base for worldwide expansion
- The gospel went "to the Jew first" historically (Acts 1-7), then to Gentiles (Acts 10-28)

*3. Not contradiction but sequence:*
- Jesus honored the covenantal priority of Israel during His incarnational ministry
- The full implications of His death and resurrection (breaking down the dividing wall, [Ephesians 2:14) were revealed after the events
- Paul's mission to Gentiles fulfilled rather than contradicted Jesus's mission

**Conclusion:** The apparent contradictions in Romans typically reflect tensions that Paul himself acknowledges and addresses. Many result from complementary rather than contradictory truths (faith and works as different aspects of salvation, sovereignty and responsibility as different perspectives on God's plan). Others reflect the progressive nature of revelation (Gentile inclusion fully realized post-resurrection). Careful attention to context, definitions, and Paul's rhetorical strategy resolves most apparent contradictions, though some genuine theological tensions (particularly regarding election) remain subjects of ongoing debate among scholars and traditions.
