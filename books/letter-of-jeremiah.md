# Letter of Jeremiah

## Authorship

While the Letter of Jeremiah purports to be written by the prophet Jeremiah, scholarship universally recognizes it as [pseudepigraphical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha), a work falsely attributed to him for authority. As early as the 4th century CE, [Jerome called it "pseudepigraphical"](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02319c.htm). The anonymous author was likely a Hellenistic Jew in Alexandria, Egypt, writing around [300 BCE](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Letter-of-Jeremiah), nearly 300 years after Jeremiah’s time. This dating is supported by a Greek fragment from the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) (c. 1st century BCE).

Scholarly debate continues on the original language, with some arguing for Greek and others for a Semitic origin like Hebrew or Aramaic, as noted by [E. H. Gifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jeremiah). The consensus rejects Jeremianic authorship due to the Hellenistic context, linguistic style, and its absence from the Hebrew Bible canon. The author's use of "seven generations" for the exile instead of Jeremiah's "seventy years" is seen as a key indicator of a later author addressing a long-standing diaspora.

## Historical Environment

The Letter of Jeremiah was composed during the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period) in the 3rd century BCE (specifically 317-306 BCE), not the 6th-century BCE exile it depicts. A [Dead Sea Scrolls fragment](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/letterjeremiah.html) confirms its antiquity. The author was an unknown Hellenistic Jew, likely from a diaspora center such as [Alexandria in Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Alexandria), addressing communities facing assimilation into the dominant Greek culture.

This era of [Hellenization](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/hellenism-2) spread Greek language, philosophy, and religion. Politically, Jews lived as subjects of foreign empires like the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](https://cojs.org/hellenistic_period-_332-166_bce/). Socially, they were minorities in a pluralistic world where idol worship was a visible, daily reality. This environment created an identity crisis for diaspora Jews, who were pressured to adopt pagan customs. The Letter directly confronts these challenges, urging faithfulness to Jewish monotheism amidst prolonged exile.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of The Letter of Jeremiah is to serve as a powerful [polemic against idolatry](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Letter-of-Jeremiah). It aims to warn and encourage diaspora Jews facing religious assimilation, social pressure, and a prolonged identity crisis during the Hellenistic period.

The author systematically refutes idol worship by exposing idols as powerless, human-made objects, thereby asserting [God's reality and sovereignty](https://www.godwhospeaks.uk/better-is-someone-upright-who-has-no-idols/). Drawing on earlier [biblical anti-idolatry traditions](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/letterjeremiah.html), the text provides theological defense, practical tools for resistance (using [ten refrains](https://www.conservapedia.com/Epistle_of_Jeremiah)), pastoral encouragement, and an intellectual apologetic for monotheism. It uniquely connects proper worship with righteous living, equipping readers to preserve their identity in a pagan world.

## Cross-References

The Letter of Jeremiah is deeply rooted in earlier biblical anti-idolatry traditions. Its author compiled and reinterpreted arguments from across the Hebrew Scriptures to address the challenges of idolatry in the Hellenistic era. The following books and sources are primary influences or share similar themes:

*   **Jeremiah**: The Letter is directly modeled on [Jeremiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+29&version=NRSVUE), which is an authentic letter from the prophet to the exiles. Its core anti-idolatry argument is an extended commentary on [Jeremiah 10:1-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+10:1-16&version=NRSVUE), especially verse 11.
*   **Baruch**: In Catholic and some Orthodox traditions, the Letter of Jeremiah is appended as **chapter 6** of the Book of Baruch, making them literary companions.
*   **2 Maccabees**: The account of Jeremiah hiding the sacred temple objects before the exile ([2 Maccabees 2:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Maccabees+2&version=NRSVACE)) provides a narrative parallel to the Letter's theme of preserving true worship against foreign threats.

## Canonical Status

The canonical status of the Letter of Jeremiah varies significantly. Jewish tradition excludes it from the Hebrew Bible, primarily because it survives in Greek, dates to the 3rd century BCE, and is considered [pseudepigraphical](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02319c.htm).

It was included in the Greek [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint), influencing its acceptance in early Christianity. Evidence of its circulation includes a fragment found among the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jeremiah).

The Catholic Church affirmed it as canonical at the [Council of Trent](httpss://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Old_Testament_canon), placing it as Baruch chapter 6. [Eastern Orthodox Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books) also consider it canonical. However, Protestant Reformers rejected its canonicity, placing it in the Apocrypha as useful but [not equal to Scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books). This divergence reflects fundamental differences in textual authority and tradition.

## Summary

The Letter of Jeremiah is a 72-verse (or 73 in some versions) polemic against idol worship, written as a letter from Jeremiah to Jewish exiles in Babylon. Using ten repeated refrains, it systematically demonstrates that idols are powerless, human-made objects utterly incapable of divine action.

The Letter opens by establishing its literary fiction and extending the exile timeline to "seven generations" (280 years)—a dramatic reinterpretation of Jeremiah's original "seventy years." It then catalogs idol impotence across numerous dimensions: they cannot speak, move, defend themselves, grant kingship, establish justice, save from danger, show mercy, or accomplish any divine function. Even natural phenomena—sun, moon, stars, wind, fire—surpass idols in power and purpose.

The text exposes temple corruption, where priests exploit sacrifices, unclean women handle sacred objects, and birds perch on supposedly divine statues. The final section employs vivid comparisons: idols are like scarecrows, corpses, and thornbushes—useless objects that decay with time.

The Letter concludes that **righteousness without idols surpasses any participation in idol worship**

> Better, therefore, is someone upright who has no idols -- Letter of Jeremiah 1:73

The work provides diaspora Jews with intellectual, theological, and pastoral arguments to resist assimilation into pagan religion while maintaining Jewish identity solely through ethical living and exclusive loyalty to YHWH.

Key themes include divine transcendence versus idol immanence, ethical religion, divine power through natural phenomena, human superiority to human-made objects, and covenant faithfulness despite prolonged exile.

## Unique Teachings

The Letter of Jeremiah presents an interesting case when examining unique biblical teachings. Unlike many other biblical books that introduce novel theological concepts, doctrines, or narratives, the Letter is fundamentally **derivative and compilatory** rather than innovative. As one scholar notes, "This book is nothing but an attack on pagan idolatry"—and anti-idolatry polemic was hardly new to Jewish literature by the Hellenistic period.

## Textual Variants

The textual history of the Letter of Jeremiah presents unique challenges compared to most biblical books. Unlike texts that exist in multiple ancient languages with substantial manuscript evidence, the Letter survives almost exclusively in Greek manuscripts, with minimal Hebrew or Aramaic evidence. This limited manuscript base means that while we can discuss variations in **versification, placement, and organization**  (where it belongs in biblical order, whether it's independent or part of Baruch), we have relatively little evidence of significant **textual variants** in the sense of different readings of the same passages.

### The Manuscript Evidence

#### Greek Manuscripts: The Primary Evidence

All surviving ancient manuscripts of the Letter of Jeremiah are in Greek. [The earliest manuscript is 7Q2 from Qumran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manuscripts_from_Qumran_Cave_7), dating to approximately the 1st century BCE. This fragment, discovered in Cave 7 at Qumran, contains verses 43-44 of the Letter and confirms that the text was circulating in Palestine in Greek by the late Second Temple period.

The Letter appears in [various Septuagint manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jeremiah) from subsequent centuries, including:
- **Codex Vaticanus** (4th century CE)
- **Codex Sinaiticus** (4th century CE)
- **Codex Alexandrinus** (5th century CE)
- Various later Greek manuscripts

These manuscripts generally show **remarkable textual stability**—the Greek text is relatively consistent across surviving witnesses, with only minor variations in word order, spelling, and grammatical forms typical of ancient manuscript transmission.

#### Absence of Hebrew/Aramaic Manuscripts

No Hebrew or Aramaic manuscript of the Letter of Jeremiah has survived, despite scholarly debate about whether the text was originally composed in a Semitic language or in Greek.

[Jerome's refusal to include the Letter in his Vulgate translation](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02319c.htm) was based precisely on this absence: "Since no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, as the other books he called apocryphal, canonical." Jerome's principle of *Hebraica veritas* ("Hebrew truth") meant he only considered texts with extant Hebrew manuscripts fully authoritative.

This absence creates a unique textual situation: we cannot compare Greek manuscripts against Hebrew or Aramaic originals to identify translation choices, expansions, omissions, or errors. The Greek text is all we have, making it impossible to reconstruct an earlier textual stage with confidence.

### Versification Differences

The most significant "variants" in the Letter of Jeremiah concern **how many verses** the text contains—a difference arising from medieval chapter and verse divisions rather than from ancient textual differences.

#### 72 vs. 73 Verses

Different manuscript traditions and modern translations enumerate the verses differently:

**72 Verses**: Some traditions, following certain Septuagint manuscripts and Latin Vulgate divisions, count the Letter as containing 72 verses.

**73 Verses**: Other traditions, including many modern English translations and some Greek manuscripts, count 73 verses.

**The Difference**: This discrepancy typically involves how verse 6 or 7 is counted in the introduction. Some manuscripts divide what others treat as a single verse into two distinct verses, creating a difference of one verse that carries through the rest of the text. Functionally, the actual textual content is identical; only the numbering differs.

**Implication for Citation**: When citing the Letter of Jeremiah, scholars must be careful to note which versification system they're using, as "Letter of Jeremiah 1:50" might refer to slightly different content depending on whether one uses the 72-verse or 73-verse system. This article uses the 73-verse system with references to "Letter of Jeremiah 1:X."

### Placement and Organization Variants

A more substantial form of textual variation involves **where the Letter appears** in biblical manuscripts and **whether it is treated as a separate book or as part of Baruch**.

#### Septuagint Tradition: Separate Book

In [Greek Septuagint manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jeremiah), the Letter of Jeremiah typically appears as a **separate book**, distinct from both Jeremiah and Baruch. Moreover, in the Septuagint arrangement, the Letter is "separated from Baruch by the Book of Lamentations," creating the sequence:

1. Jeremiah
2. Baruch
3. Lamentations
4. Letter of Jeremiah

This arrangement treats the Letter as an independent prophetic text, though one associated with the Jeremianic tradition.

#### Latin Vulgate Tradition: Baruch Chapter 6

In [the Latin Vulgate](http://mbfallon.com/Baruch/5_letter_of_jeremiah.pdf) and Bibles influenced by it (including Catholic Bibles), the Letter of Jeremiah is **combined with Baruch as chapter 6**. This creates the Book of Baruch with six chapters:

1. Baruch 1-5 (the main text of Baruch)
2. Baruch 6 (the Letter of Jeremiah)

**Historical Development**: This arrangement was not original to the Vulgate. Initially, Jerome excluded both Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah as non-canonical. However, "in the 9th century the Vetus Latina texts of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah were introduced into the Vulgate in versions revised by Theodulf of Orleans." By the 13th century, "when the booksellers of Paris began to produce commercial single volume Vulgate bibles in large numbers, these commonly included both Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah as the Book of Baruch."

This combination made practical sense: both texts are deuterocanonical, both are associated with the prophet Jeremiah, and both address the Babylonian exile context. Combining them created a more substantial "book" (six chapters instead of five and one).

#### Orthodox Tradition: Variable

[Eastern Orthodox Bibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books) show variation:
- Some Orthodox traditions treat the Letter as a **separate book**, following the Septuagint arrangement
- Other Orthodox traditions include it as **part of Baruch**, following a practice similar to the Vulgate

This variation reflects the Eastern Church's generally less rigid approach to canonical boundaries and textual organization.

#### The Synod of Laodicea (4th Century)

Early evidence of combining these texts comes from the [Synod of Laodicea](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/), which "wrote that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle are canonical in only one book." This suggests that as early as the 4th century CE, some Christian communities were grouping all Jeremianic material together as a single literary unit.

### Scholarly Debate: Original Language

While not strictly a "textual variant" in the traditional sense, scholarly debate about the Letter's **original language** affects how we understand its textual history.

#### Arguments for Greek Original

[E. H. Gifford reported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jeremiah) that "the great majority of competent and impartial critics" considered Greek to be the original language, with O. F. Fritzsche stating emphatically, "If any one of the Apocryphal books was composed in Greek, this certainly was."

Evidence supporting Greek original composition includes:
- **Linguistic features**: "The Greek text has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew; this shows that the Greek text is more than a minimalist translation."
- **No Semitic original ever discovered**: Despite extensive searches and the recovery of Hebrew texts of Sirach and Tobit among the Dead Sea Scrolls and at Masada, no Hebrew or Aramaic Letter of Jeremiah has emerged.
- **Hellenistic context**: The text's probable composition in Alexandria, a Greek-speaking center of Hellenistic Judaism, makes Greek composition plausible.

#### Arguments for Hebrew/Aramaic Original

Other scholars argue for an original Semitic language (Hebrew or Aramaic) that was later translated into Greek:
- **Semitic idioms**: "Certain linguistic and stylistic elements characteristic of Semitic languages" appear in the Greek text, suggesting translation from Hebrew or Aramaic.
- **Pattern of Jewish religious literature**: Most Jewish religious texts of this period were composed in Hebrew or Aramaic, even if later translated into Greek for diaspora use.
- **The general pattern**: Other deuterocanonical books (Tobit, Sirach, 1 Maccabees) were originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic despite surviving primarily or exclusively in Greek.

#### Current Consensus

"In recent years the tide of opinion has shifted and now the consensus is that the 'letter' was originally composed in Hebrew," though significant scholars continue to defend Greek original composition. This debate remains unresolved, and absent discovery of a Semitic manuscript, definitive proof is impossible.

**Implications**: If the Letter was originally Hebrew or Aramaic, then all surviving Greek manuscripts represent translations, and we should expect some translation variations and interpretive choices embedded in the Greek text. If it was originally Greek, then the surviving manuscripts more directly reflect the author's work.

### Minor Textual Variations

Within the Greek manuscript tradition itself, scholars have identified various **minor textual variants**—differences in wording, word order, spelling, and grammatical forms between manuscripts. However, these variants are generally:

1. **Minor in scope**: Involving individual words or phrases rather than substantial passages
2. **Non-theological**: Not affecting the meaning or theological content significantly
3. **Typical of manuscript transmission**: Similar to variations found in any ancient text copied by hand over centuries
4. **Uncontroversial**: Not subject to major scholarly debate

Examples of typical minor variants include:
- Differences in grammatical forms (e.g., singular vs. plural)
- Variations in word order (Greek word order is flexible)
- Spelling differences (ancient Greek had no standardized orthography)
- Minor additions or omissions of articles, conjunctions, or particles

Unfortunately, detailed critical apparatuses documenting all specific textual variants in the Letter of Jeremiah are not widely available in English scholarship, as the text has received less critical attention than canonical books. The most comprehensive textual work exists in specialized German and French Septuagint studies.

### Comparison with the Book of Jeremiah's Textual Situation

It's instructive to compare the Letter of Jeremiah's textual situation with that of the canonical Book of Jeremiah, which has one of the most complex textual histories in the Hebrew Bible.

The **canonical Book of Jeremiah** exists in two substantially different versions:
- **Masoretic Text (Hebrew)**: Longer version with approximately 2,700 words more than the Greek
- **Septuagint**: Shorter version with different chapter order

Scholarly debate continues about which version is earlier and whether the differences represent editorial expansion, deliberate abridgment, or use of different Hebrew textual traditions.

In stark contrast, the **Letter of Jeremiah** shows minimal variation across witnesses. This relative stability might reflect:
- **Later composition**: Written after the main prophetic books when textual practices were more standardized
- **Limited circulation**: Less widely copied and therefore fewer opportunities for textual divergence
- **Shorter length**: A brief text of 72-73 verses has less opportunity for variation than a major prophetic book
- **Functional nature**: As a practical polemic rather than a prophetic oracle collection, it may have been treated more carefully

## Textual Errors

Unlike canonical books where extensive textual criticism has identified numerous copying errors and variants, the Letter of Jeremiah has received less scholarly attention.

### The Fundamental Chronological Error

The most obvious and universally acknowledged "error" in the Letter of Jeremiah is its **false attribution to the prophet Jeremiah**—though whether this constitutes an "error" or intentional pseudepigraphical literary fiction is debatable.

#### The Problem

The text explicitly claims: "This is a copy of the letter sent by Jeremiah to the people of Jerusalem who were about to be carried away as prisoners to Babylon" (Letter of Jeremiah 1:1). However, as discussed in [the Authorship section](#authorship), scholars universally agree that [the text was written approximately 300 years after the prophet Jeremiah's lifetime](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Letter-of-Jeremiah), most likely around 300 BCE rather than during the 6th-century BCE Babylonian exile.

**Evidence of Later Composition**:
1. The Greek language and Hellenistic cultural context
2. Literary dependence on texts (like Isaiah 44, Psalms 115, 135) that post-date or are contemporaneous with Jeremiah
3. The "seven generations" timeframe (discussed below)
4. Concerns reflecting Hellenistic rather than Neo-Babylonian period challenges

### The "Seven Generations" Discrepancy

A specific chronological issue involves the Letter's prediction about exile duration.

#### The Problem

The Letter states: "When you reach Babylon you will be there many years, a long time—**seven generations**; after that I will bring you back from there in peace" (Letter of Jeremiah 1:3).

This contradicts the canonical Book of Jeremiah, where the prophet predicts: "When **seventy years** are completed for Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to return to this place" (Jeremiah 29:10).

**Mathematical Calculation**: Seven generations of forty years each equals 280 years. Subtracting 280 years from 597 BCE (the first deportation) yields 317 BCE—precisely the Hellenistic period and likely date of the Letter's composition.

#### Scholarly Explanations

**Intentional Update, Not Error**: As scholar J. T. Marshall notes, the use of "seven generations" rather than "seventy years" "points away from Jeremiah towards one who deplored the long exile." This was likely a **deliberate reinterpretation** rather than a mistake. By the 3rd century BCE, Jews had been living in diaspora for nearly three centuries, far exceeding Jeremiah's seventy-year prediction. The author updates the timeline to reflect reality: exile would not end quickly but would last many generations.

**Typological Rather Than Literal Reading**: The author may have understood Jeremiah 29:10's "seventy years" typologically rather than literally—as symbolizing a complete period of divine judgment rather than precisely 70 years. "Seven generations" extends this symbolic completeness: seven (the number of perfection) multiplied by generation (40 years) yields a theologically significant timeframe.

**Addressing Cognitive Dissonance**: Diaspora Jews faced a theological problem: Jeremiah prophesied return after seventy years, yet centuries later Jews remained scattered throughout the Mediterranean and Near East. The Letter addresses this dissonance by extending the predicted timeline, suggesting that return would eventually occur but not soon.

**Critical Perspective**: From a critical scholarly view, this "update" reveals the text's true composition date. An author writing in 300 BCE looked back at nearly 300 years of exile and projected that Jews would remain in diaspora indefinitely—accurately, as it turned out, since large diaspora communities persisted even after some Jews returned to Judea.

## Contradictions

The most significant contradictions concern its relationship to the canonical Book of Jeremiah and the theological problems with the fact that someone else wrote it using Jeremiah's name and that it describes an exile lasting much longer than it actually did.

### Exile Duration - Permanent or Temporary?

**The Contradiction**: The Letter creates potential tension regarding whether diaspora is **temporary** or **permanent**.

On one hand, the Letter promises eventual return: "after that I will bring you back from there in peace" (Letter of Jeremiah 1:3). This suggests exile is temporary, lasting seven generations but ultimately ending.

On the other hand, the Letter's entire practical focus addresses how to maintain Jewish identity **indefinitely in diaspora**—rejecting idolatry, maintaining ethical living, trusting that righteousness without idols surpasses participation in pagan religion. This suggests permanent diaspora existence.

**Why This Seems Contradictory**: Is the Letter preparing Jews for temporary exile with eventual restoration or for permanent diaspora existence? The tension between promised return and practical accommodation to indefinite diaspora creates interpretive ambiguity.

**Possible Explanations**:

1. **Both/And Rather Than Either/Or**: The Letter acknowledges both realities—**theologically**, Jews will eventually return (maintaining hope and covenantal promise); **practically**, they must maintain faithfulness for many generations in diaspora (providing guidance for the foreseeable future). These aren't contradictory but complementary: hope for eventual restoration doesn't negate the need for practical diaspora living in the meantime.

2. **Spiritual vs. Physical Return**: The "return" might be understood **spiritually** rather than solely geographically—Jews remain faithful to God despite physical diaspora, achieving covenant relationship regardless of location. The Letter's conclusion—"better is someone upright who has no idols" (Letter of Jeremiah 1:73)—suggests that righteousness matters more than geographic location.

3. **Historical Reality**: By the time the Letter was written (3rd century BCE), some Jews had returned to Judea following Cyrus's decree (538 BCE), while large communities remained in diaspora by choice or circumstance. The Letter addresses this mixed reality—return is possible but diaspora may be permanent for many Jews. Both situations require faithfulness to God and rejection of idolatry.

### Idol Impotence - Are They Dangerous or Harmless?

**The Contradiction**: The Letter seems to send mixed messages about whether idols pose a **genuine threat** requiring urgent warnings or are merely **harmless** objects unworthy of concern.

**Evidence of Danger**: The text's intensity, repeated warnings, and comprehensive arguments suggest idols represent a serious threat to Jewish faith. Why devote 72 verses to refuting something harmless?

**Evidence of Harmlessness**: The entire argument demonstrates idols are powerless, lifeless, dependent on human care, and incapable of any action. They're compared to scarecrows, corpses, and thornbushes—utterly impotent. The repeated refrain "do not fear them" implies they pose no real danger.

**Why This Seems Contradictory**: If idols are truly powerless and harmless as described, why the urgent, extensive polemic? If they're dangerous enough to warrant 72 verses of warnings, doesn't that suggest they possess some power?

**Possible Explanations**:

1. **Psychological vs. Ontological Threat**: Idols pose no **ontological** threat (they have no real power) but significant **psychological and social threat** (Jews might defect to idolatry for social, economic, or cultural reasons). The Letter addresses not what idols can do (nothing) but what Jews might do (abandon their faith). The threat comes from human temptation and social pressure, not from idols' power.

2. **Demonic Reality**: While the Letter doesn't explicitly invoke demons, some theological traditions understand idol worship as demonic activity—the idols themselves are powerless, but demons use them to deceive people. The threat lies not in the wood and gold but in the spiritual deception idolatry represents. This interpretation reads demonology into the text rather than deriving it from the text itself.

3. **Social and Economic Consequences**: The danger isn't that idols will harm Jews but that participating in idol worship carries consequences—assimilation, loss of Jewish identity, abandonment of Torah ethics, and ultimately separation from covenant relationship with God. The Letter warns against these consequences by exposing idol worship's futility.

4. **Apologetic Necessity**: In Hellenistic society, where paganism was culturally dominant and visually impressive, Jews needed robust arguments for maintaining their distinctive faith. The Letter provides these arguments—not because idols are powerful but because the cultural pressure to conform is powerful.

## Credibility

Major [textual variants](#textual-variants):
* The Letter of Jeremiah survives **exclusively in Greek manuscripts** with no extant Hebrew or Aramaic versions.
* Versification differs (72 vs. 73 verses), but this reflects medieval numbering conventions rather than substantive textual differences.
