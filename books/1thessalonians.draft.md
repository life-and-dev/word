# 1 Thessalonians

## Authorship

The Apostle Paul is widely considered the primary author of the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, a view held by the vast majority of New Testament scholars. Co-authored with Silas (Silvanus) and Timothy, the letter explicitly states their involvement in the opening verse (1 Thessalonians 1:1), though Paul's use of the first-person singular "I" confirms his leading role.

The authenticity of 1 Thessalonians, while questioned by some 19th-century scholars, is now largely undisputed due to strong internal and external evidence. Its style, vocabulary, and theological themes are consistent with other Pauline writings. Internal evidence aligns with Paul's second missionary journey details in Acts 17. External evidence includes attestations from early church fathers like Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian.

Likely written from Corinth between 49-51 AD, 1 Thessalonians is among the earliest New Testament books. This dating is supported by the Delphi Inscription, which places Gallio's proconsulship in Achaia around 51-52 AD, correlating with Paul's time in Corinth mentioned in Acts.

## Historical Environment

Written by the Apostle Paul from Corinth (c. 49-51 AD), 1 Thessalonians is addressed to a new church in Thessalonica, the bustling capital of Macedonia. A strategic trade hub, the city was a cosmopolitan mix of Greek culture and Roman governance. Paul, Silas, and Timothy founded the church there but were forced to leave due to persecution (Acts 17:7). The congregation, composed mainly of Gentile converts, faced ongoing hostility and had urgent questions about Christian living and the fate of believers who had died. Paul wrote to encourage them in their suffering, instruct them on matters like sexual purity, and clarify the doctrine of the resurrection and Christ's second coming.

## Purpose

The first letter to the Thessalonians was written with several key purposes in mind, all aimed at supporting a young and persecuted church. Paul, having been forced to leave Thessalonica prematurely, was anxious to know how the new converts were faring. His primary goals for writing were:

*   **Encouragement and Commendation:** Paul begins the letter with heartfelt thanks for the Thessalonians' "work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope" (1:3). He commends their endurance in the face of persecution and affirms that they have become an example to other believers in Macedonia and Achaia. This encouragement was vital for a community under pressure.

*   **Instruction in Holy Living:** Paul provides practical guidance on how to live a life that is pleasing to God. He addresses issues of sexual morality, urging the believers to "abstain from sexual immorality" and to "control his own body in holiness and honor" (4:3-4). He also emphasizes the importance of brotherly love, responsible work, and respect for church leaders.

*   **Clarification on Christ's Second Coming:** A major concern for the Thessalonians was the fate of believers who had died. Paul addresses this by explaining the order of events at the resurrection, assuring them that "the dead in Christ will rise first" (4:16). He also corrects any misunderstanding that the "day of the Lord" had already come, and he encourages them to be watchful and sober. The theme of Christ's return is a prominent feature of the letter, appearing in every chapter.

*   **Affirmation of Paul's Ministry:** Paul takes the opportunity to defend his motives and conduct while he was in Thessalonica. He reminds them that he came not with "flattering words" or a "pretext for greed" but as a gentle and caring apostle (2:5-7). This was likely to counter any false accusations that may have arisen after his departure.

*   **Promotion of Love and Community:** Throughout the letter, Paul encourages the Thessalonians to "increase and abound in love for one another and for all" (3:12). He urges them to "encourage one another and build one another up" (5:11). This emphasis on mutual love and support was essential for the health and growth of the church.

In essence, 1 Thessalonians is a pastoral letter that combines personal affection, theological instruction, and practical exhortation. It provides a model for how to encourage and guide a new community of believers, especially in a hostile environment.

## Cross-References

While 1 Thessalonians does not contain direct quotations from the Old Testament, it is richly connected to other New Testament writings through shared themes, historical events, and theological concepts. These cross-references help to illuminate the context and message of the letter.

*   **Historical Context in Acts:** The book of Acts provides the narrative background for 1 Thessalonians. Acts 17:1-9 describes Paul's arrival in Thessalonica, his preaching in the synagogue, the conversion of a group of Jews and Gentiles, and the subsequent persecution that forced Paul and Silas to flee the city. This account in Acts is essential for understanding the circumstances that prompted Paul to write the letter.

*   **Theological Parallels in Paul's Other Letters:** Many of the themes in 1 Thessalonians are also found in Paul's other epistles. For example:
    *   The call to be "imitators" of Paul and of the Lord (1 Thessalonians 1:6) is echoed in 1 Corinthians 4:16 and 11:1.
    *   The teaching on the resurrection of the dead and the return of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) is also discussed in 1 Corinthians 15.
    *   The emphasis on sanctification and holy living (1 Thessalonians 4:1-8) is a common theme in Paul's writings, such as Romans 6 and 12.
    *   The concept of the "wrath to come" (1 Thessalonians 1:10) is also mentioned in Romans 5:9.

*   **Shared Co-Senders:** The opening of 1 Thessalonians (1:1) mentions Silvanus (Silas) and Timothy as co-senders with Paul. These individuals are also mentioned in other New Testament books, which helps to establish a network of relationships and a consistent timeline. For example, Silvanus and Timothy are mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:19.

*   **Thematic Connections with Other New Testament Writers:** The teachings of 1 Thessalonians also resonate with the writings of other New Testament authors. For example:
    *   The emphasis on hope in the face of suffering (1 Thessalonians 1:3) is a major theme in 1 Peter.
    *   The description of the "day of the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 5:1-11) has parallels in the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels (e.g., Matthew 24) and in the book of Revelation.

While direct quotations are not the primary form of cross-referencing for 1 Thessalonians, the letter is deeply embedded in the broader context of the New Testament. Its historical setting, theological themes, and personal connections all contribute to a richer understanding of its message.

## Canonical Status

The First Epistle to the Thessalonians has been a part of the New Testament canon from a very early stage. Its inclusion is a testament to its widespread acceptance and use in the early church. The letter is found in the earliest extant list of New Testament books, the Muratorian Canon (c. 170 AD), and it was consistently cited as authoritative by early church fathers such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian.

There has been very little debate or controversy regarding the canonical status of 1 Thessalonians. Its Pauline authorship, early date, and theological content all contributed to its ready acceptance into the canon. The letter's focus on the return of Christ and its practical instructions for Christian living were highly valued by the early church.

However, there have been some scholarly debates regarding the textual integrity of the letter, particularly in relation to 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16. This passage, which speaks of God's wrath coming upon the Jews, has been a subject of controversy. Some scholars have argued that these verses are a later interpolation, citing their harsh tone and alleged inconsistencies with Paul's other writings.

The arguments against the authenticity of 2:13-16 include:
*   **Anti-Semitic Tone:** The passage has been seen as uncharacteristically anti-Jewish for Paul, who in other places expresses great sorrow for his fellow Israelites (e.g., Romans 9:1-5).
*   **Chronological Issues:** Some scholars have argued that the statement "the wrath of God has come upon them at last" (2:16) refers to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, which would place the writing of the letter after Paul's death.
*   **Grammatical and Stylistic Differences:** Some have pointed to what they see as non-Pauline grammatical features in the passage.

Despite these arguments, the majority of scholars today accept 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16 as an authentic part of the letter. The arguments for its authenticity include:
*   **Manuscript Evidence:** There is no manuscript evidence to suggest that these verses were ever missing from the letter.
*   **Rhetorical Connection:** The passage is rhetorically connected to the surrounding verses, and its removal would disrupt the flow of Paul's argument.
*   **Consistency with Paul's Theology:** The concept of God's wrath is not foreign to Paul's theology (e.g., Romans 1:18-32).

While the debate over 2:13-16 is significant, it has not affected the overall canonical status of 1 Thessalonians. The letter as a whole is firmly established as a part of the New Testament canon.

## Summary

### Chapter 1: A Model of Faith and Conversion

The first chapter of 1 Thessalonians serves as a powerful introduction to the letter, establishing a tone of warmth, encouragement, and thanksgiving. Paul, along with his companions Silvanus and Timothy, begins with a customary greeting of "grace to you and peace" (1:1). He immediately expresses his profound gratitude for the Thessalonian believers, highlighting their "work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" (1:3).

Paul emphasizes that the gospel came to the Thessalonians not just in words, but "in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction" (1:5). This is a key aspect of inspired text, as it points to the divine origin and power of the message they received. The Thessalonians, in turn, became "imitators of us and of the Lord," receiving the word with "joy inspired by the Holy Spirit" despite facing severe suffering (1:6).

The genuineness of their conversion was so evident that they became a model for other believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The "word of the Lord" sounded forth from them, and their faith in God became known everywhere (1:8). This transformation was characterized by a decisive turning from idols "to serve the living and true God" (1:9).

The chapter concludes with a clear statement of the Thessalonians' hope: "to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come" (1:10). This verse encapsulates the core of their new faith: a living relationship with God, a turning from false worship, and a confident expectation of Christ's return.

This first chapter is a testament to the transformative power of the gospel. It shows how a community can be established in faith, love, and hope, even in the midst of adversity. It also highlights the importance of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers and confirming the truth of the gospel message.

### Chapter 2: The Heart of a True Apostle

In chapter 2, Paul defends the integrity of his ministry and expresses his deep affection for the Thessalonian believers. He reminds them that his visit was not "a failure" (2:1), but was marked by boldness and sincerity, despite the opposition he faced. He contrasts his own motives with those of false teachers, declaring that he did not come with "flattering words" or a "pretext for greed" (2:5).

Paul's relationship with the Thessalonians was not that of a distant authority figure, but of a loving parent. He describes himself as being "gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children" (2:7). He also compares his ministry to that of a father, "exhorting and encouraging and charging each one of you to walk in a manner worthy of God" (2:11-12). This combination of maternal tenderness and paternal guidance reveals the depth of his pastoral care.

A crucial point in this chapter is Paul's commendation of the Thessalonians for how they received his message. He thanks God that they "received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God" (2:13). This is a powerful statement about the divine authority of the apostolic preaching. The "word of God" was at work in them, enabling them to endure persecution from their own countrymen, just as the churches in Judea had suffered.

The chapter concludes with Paul's intense desire to see the Thessalonians again. He explains that he had been hindered by Satan from returning to them, but that they are his "hope and joy and crown of boasting" before the Lord Jesus at his coming (2:19). This reveals the deep personal bond that Paul had with the church and his longing for their continued growth and perseverance.

### Chapter 3: Encouragement and Prayer

Chapter 3 continues to express Paul's deep pastoral concern for the Thessalonian church. Unable to bear his anxiety any longer, Paul sent Timothy to them from Athens to "establish and exhort you in your faith" (3:2). This was a crucial mission, as Paul was worried that the "tempter" might have taken advantage of their afflictions and that his labor might have been in vain (3:5).

The turning point of the chapter is Timothy's return with a good report of the Thessalonians' faith and love. This news brought immense comfort and joy to Paul, who exclaims, "For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord" (3:8). The report of their steadfastness was a source of great encouragement to Paul in the midst of his own distress and persecution.

Paul's response to this good news is a heartfelt prayer for the Thessalonians. He prays "night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith" (3:10). This shows that while he is overjoyed at their progress, he also recognizes that they are still a young church in need of further instruction.

The chapter concludes with a beautiful prayer that serves as a benediction: "Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints" (3:11-13). This prayer encapsulates the major themes of the letter: love, holiness, and the hope of Christ's return. It is a powerful expression of Paul's desire for the spiritual well-being of the Thessalonian believers.

### Chapter 4: A Life Pleasing to God

Chapter 4 marks a shift in the letter from personal reflections to practical instructions. Paul begins by urging the Thessalonians to "walk and please God" (4:1). He specifically addresses the issue of sexual immorality, which was rampant in the Greco-Roman world. He exhorts them to "abstain from sexual immorality" and to "control his own body in holiness and honor" (4:3-4). This is not merely a matter of human ethics, but a divine command: "For this is the will of God, your sanctification" (4:3).

Paul also encourages the Thessalonians to "increase more and more" in their love for one another (4:10). He commends them for the love they already have, but he urges them to aspire to a "quiet life, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands" (4:11). This would ensure that they would "walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one" (4:12).

The second half of the chapter addresses a key concern of the Thessalonian church: the fate of believers who had died. Paul does not want them to "grieve as others do who have no hope" (4:13). He then provides one of the most detailed descriptions of the second coming of Christ in the New Testament.

This is a passage of immense importance, as it contains direct prophetic teaching. Paul reveals that "the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord" (4:16-17).

This passage is a cornerstone of Christian eschatology. It provides comfort and hope to believers, assuring them that death is not the end and that they will be reunited with their loved ones in the presence of the Lord. Paul concludes this section by saying, "Therefore encourage one another with these words" (4:18).

### Chapter 5: Final Instructions and Benediction

The final chapter of 1 Thessalonians continues the theme of the Lord's return, but with a focus on readiness and right conduct. Paul explains that the "day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night" (5:2). For those who are in darkness, it will be a time of sudden destruction. But for believers, who are "children of light and children of the day" (5:5), it should not be a surprise.

Paul uses this teaching to exhort the Thessalonians to be watchful and sober. He encourages them to put on the "breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation" (5:8). He reminds them that "God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ" (5:9). This is a message of assurance and confidence for all who believe.

The second half of the chapter contains a series of concise and powerful exhortations for Christian living. These include:
*   Respecting and esteeming church leaders (5:12-13).
*   Admonishing the idle, encouraging the fainthearted, helping the weak, and being patient with everyone (5:14).
*   Always seeking to do good to one another and to everyone (5:15).
*   A trio of commands that are at the heart of a Spirit-filled life: "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you" (5:16-18).
*   Instructions concerning the Holy Spirit: "Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil" (5:19-22).

The letter concludes with a final prayer and benediction. Paul prays for the complete sanctification of the Thessalonians, that their "whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (5:23). He expresses his confidence that "he who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it" (5:24).

The final verses contain personal greetings and a solemn charge that the letter be read to all the brethren. The closing words, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you" (5:28), are a fitting end to a letter that is filled with grace, encouragement, and hope.

## Unique Teachings

As one of the earliest Christian documents, 1 Thessalonians provides a unique window into the theological concerns of a nascent church. While many of its themes are common to Paul's other letters, it gives special prominence to certain teachings.

*   **The Doctrine of the "Rapture":** The most distinctive teaching in 1 Thessalonians is the detailed description of the return of Christ in 4:13-18. This passage is the primary source for the doctrine of the "rapture," the belief that living believers will be "caught up" to meet the Lord in the air. While the term "rapture" is not used in the text, the concept has had a profound influence on Christian eschatology. The teaching was given to comfort and encourage the Thessalonians, who were grieving for deceased believers.

*   **Salvation in Three Tenses:** The letter presents a comprehensive view of salvation, encompassing its past, present, and future dimensions.
    *   **Past:** Believers have been "chosen" by God (1:4) and have "turned to God from idols" (1:9).
    *   **Present:** They are being "sanctified" (4:3) and are called to "walk in a manner worthy of God" (2:12).
    *   **Future:** They are waiting for the "Son from heaven" (1:10) and will be "saved from the wrath to come" (5:9).
    This threefold perspective provides a balanced understanding of the Christian life.

*   **Emphasis on Sanctification:** Paul places a strong emphasis on the importance of sanctification, which he describes as "the will of God" (4:3). He provides practical instructions on how to live a holy life, particularly in the area of sexual purity. This emphasis on practical holiness is a hallmark of the letter.

*   **Perseverance Amidst Persecution:** The theme of suffering and perseverance runs throughout the letter. The Thessalonians are commended for their endurance in the face of persecution, and they are encouraged to continue to stand firm in their faith. This teaching is particularly relevant for churches that are facing opposition and hostility.

*   **The Role of the Holy Spirit:** The Holy Spirit is mentioned several times in the letter, and his work is seen as essential for the Christian life. The Spirit empowers the preaching of the gospel (1:5), produces joy in the midst of suffering (1:6), and is the agent of sanctification (4:8). Paul also warns against "quenching the Spirit" (5:19), indicating the importance of being open to his leading and guidance.

These unique teachings have made 1 Thessalonians a vital resource for the church throughout its history. The letter's focus on hope, holiness, and the return of Christ continues to inspire and challenge believers today.

## Textual Variants

The textual history of 1 Thessalonians is relatively stable, and there are no major variants that would call into question the core message of the letter. However, as with any ancient document, there are a number of minor variations in the surviving Greek manuscripts. These variants are the result of scribal errors, intentional changes, or other factors in the transmission of the text.

It is important to distinguish between textual variants within the New Testament manuscripts and the differences between the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) and the Masoretic Text (the Hebrew text of the Old Testament). Since 1 Thessalonians does not contain any direct quotations from the Old Testament, the latter issue is not directly relevant to this letter.

Some of the most significant textual variants in 1 Thessalonians include:

*   **1 Thessalonians 1:1:** Some manuscripts add the phrase "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" after "Grace to you and peace." This is likely a scribal addition to make the greeting conform to the pattern of Paul's other letters.

*   **1 Thessalonians 2:7:** There is a well-known variant between "infants" (νήπιοι) and "gentle" (ἤπιοι). The two words are very similar in Greek, and it is easy to see how a scribe could have confused them. While "gentle" seems to fit the context better, "infants" has strong manuscript support.

*   **1 Thessalonians 5:28:** Some manuscripts add "Amen" at the end of the letter. This is a common scribal addition to mark the conclusion of a book.

These and other minor variants are noted in critical editions of the Greek New Testament and are taken into account by modern translators. While they are of interest to scholars, they do not significantly affect the meaning or interpretation of the letter. The overall message of 1 Thessalonians is clear and well-attested in the manuscript tradition.

## Textual Errors

The study of textual errors in 1 Thessalonians, as in other New Testament books, involves the careful analysis of variations in the manuscript tradition. These "errors" are not necessarily mistakes in the modern sense, but rather differences that have arisen through the process of copying the text by hand over many centuries.

One of the most debated textual issues in 1 Thessalonians is found in **1 Thessalonians 2:7**. The Greek text has a single-letter difference that results in two possible readings:
*   "we were **infants** (νήπιοι) among you"
*   "we were **gentle** (ἤπιοι) among you"

Scholarly opinion is divided on which reading is original.
*   **Arguments for "infants" (νήπιοι):** This reading is found in some of the earliest and best manuscripts. Some scholars argue that it is the more "difficult" reading, and therefore more likely to be original, as scribes would be more inclined to change it to the more contextually appropriate "gentle."
*   **Arguments for "gentle" (ἤπιοι):** The immediate context, which compares Paul and his companions to a "nursing mother," seems to favor this reading. Paul typically uses the word "infants" in a negative sense to describe immaturity, which would be out of place here.

Beyond this specific variant, some scholars have raised questions about the overall compositional integrity of 1 Thessalonians. Some have proposed that the letter as we have it is a composite of two or more originally separate letters. This theory is based on perceived tensions and abrupt shifts in tone and subject matter within the letter. For example, the transition between chapter 2 and chapter 3 has been seen as a possible seam between two different letters.

However, the majority of scholars today view 1 Thessalonians as a single, unified composition. They argue that the perceived tensions can be explained by the pastoral nature of the letter, which addresses a variety of concerns and emotions. The letter's structure can be seen as a natural flow of thought from a concerned and affectionate pastor to his beloved church.

While these scholarly debates are important for a full understanding of the letter, it is important to remember that they do not affect the core theological message of 1 Thessalonians. The letter's teachings on faith, hope, love, and the return of Christ are clear and consistent throughout the manuscript tradition.

## Contradictions

When examining 1 Thessalonians for contradictions, it is important to distinguish between genuine internal inconsistencies and issues that arise from historical, cultural, or theological differences between the first century and today. Most of the alleged contradictions in 1 Thessalonians fall into the latter category.

*   **The Imminent Return of Christ:** One of the most frequently cited "problems" in 1 Thessalonians is the strong sense of an imminent *parousia* (return) of Christ. Paul's language in 4:15-17, where he speaks of "we who are alive, who are left," seems to suggest that he expected to be alive when Christ returned. Since this did not happen, some critics have charged Paul with a prophetic error.

    *   **Scholarly Explanations:** Theologians and scholars have offered several explanations for this. Some suggest that Paul's understanding of the timing of the *parousia* may have developed over time. Others argue that the "we" in this passage is a pastoral "we," meant to include all believers, both living and dead, in the hope of the resurrection. Still others maintain that the language of imminence is a common feature of prophetic discourse, intended to foster a sense of urgency and watchfulness, rather than to provide a specific timeline.

*   **Social and Moral Norms:** Like other New Testament writings, 1 Thessalonians reflects the social and cultural norms of its time. For example, the letter does not explicitly condemn the institution of slavery, which was widespread in the Roman Empire. This has led some to criticize the letter for its failure to address what is now universally recognized as a grave social evil.

    *   **Contextual Understanding:** It is important to read the letter in its historical context. While Paul does not call for the abolition of slavery, his teachings on love, equality in Christ (Galatians 3:28), and mutual respect would have had a transformative effect on the master-slave relationship. His primary focus was on the spiritual transformation of individuals, which would in turn lead to social change.

*   **Alleged Internal Contradictions:** Some critics have pointed to what they see as internal contradictions within the letter. For example, *The Skeptic's Annotated Bible* questions who raised Jesus from the dead, citing 1 Thessalonians 1:10 ("whom he raised from the dead") and comparing it with other passages that speak of Jesus rising from the dead. However, these are not mutually exclusive statements. The New Testament consistently affirms that God the Father raised Jesus from the dead, and that Jesus himself had the power to take up his own life again (John 10:18).

Most of the alleged contradictions in 1 Thessalonians can be resolved through careful attention to the historical and literary context, as well as a nuanced understanding of the theological message of the letter. While there are certainly challenging passages that require careful interpretation, there are no clear and undeniable contradictions that would undermine the overall integrity of the book.
