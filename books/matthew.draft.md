# Matthew

## Authorship

The question of who wrote the Gospel of Matthew has generated substantial scholarly debate, with traditional Christian attribution to the apostle Matthew contrasting with modern critical scholarship's majority view of anonymous authorship. This debate involves both external testimony from early church fathers and internal evidence from the Gospel itself.

**Early Church Testimony**: The earliest explicit attribution of this Gospel to Matthew comes from Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60-130 CE), bishop and Apostolic Father, whose testimony is preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea (circa 320 CE). Eusebius quotes Papias as stating that "Matthew compiled the Oracles [logia] in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well as he could." This cryptic statement has generated considerable interpretive debate: Does "Oracles" refer to the complete Gospel, a collection of Jesus' sayings, or an earlier Aramaic/Hebrew source? Does Papias refer to our canonical Greek Matthew, or to a different composition? Conservative scholars often argue that Papias refers to an original Hebrew/Aramaic Gospel that Matthew composed, which was subsequently translated into the Greek text we possess. Critical scholars question whether Papias actually knew the authorship firsthand or was passing along later tradition.

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 CE), writing around 180 CE in *Against Heresies* 3.1.1, provides more explicit testimony: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church." Irenaeus, who had personal connection to Polycarp (who knew the Apostle John), represents an important link in the chain of tradition. His testimony places Matthew's composition during the ministries of Peter and Paul in Rome (c. 60-67 CE), suggesting an earlier date than most modern scholars accept. All surviving Greek manuscripts with intact superscriptions bear the title "According to Matthew" (ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΘΘΑΙΟΝ), demonstrating universal early attribution to Matthew in the manuscript tradition.

**Traditional Authorship Arguments**: Conservative scholarship defends Matthean authorship based on several considerations: (1) The unanimous early church tradition attributing the Gospel to Matthew, with no competing tradition suggesting alternative authorship; (2) The Gospel's detailed knowledge of Jewish customs, geography, and Scripture, consistent with a Jewish author; (3) The emphasis on financial matters and specific monetary references (such as [Matthew 17:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#24) regarding the temple tax), potentially reflecting Matthew's background as a tax collector; (4) The inclusion of the calling narrative in [Matthew 9:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#9) where Jesus calls "Matthew" (compared to "Levi" in Mark and Luke), possibly indicating authorial modesty or self-reference; (5) The lack of compelling reason why the early church would attribute authorship to a relatively minor apostle rather than a more prominent figure if the attribution were fabricated.

**Critical Scholarship's Anonymous Author Theory**: The majority of contemporary New Testament scholars conclude that the Gospel was composed by an anonymous Jewish-Christian author, probably not an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry. Primary arguments include: (1) The Gospel shows clear literary dependence on Mark's Gospel (using approximately 90% of Mark's content with stylistic improvements), which seems unlikely if the author were himself an eyewitness who could rely on personal memory; (2) The sophisticated Greek literary structure, careful arrangement of material into five major discourse sections (paralleling the Pentateuch), and polished style suggest an educated writer working decades after the events rather than a Galilean tax collector writing in the 60s; (3) The Gospel reflects concerns of a later Jewish-Christian community dealing with separation from the synagogue and defining its identity, suggesting composition after 70 CE; (4) The use of the title "Matthew" may simply reflect scribal tradition or association with Matthean source material (perhaps the "logia" mentioned by Papias) rather than complete Gospel authorship.

**Dating Considerations**: Traditional scholarship, following Papias and Irenaeus, dates Matthew to the 60s CE, before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Advocates point to [Matthew 24:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#2) as genuine prophecy rather than *vaticinium ex eventu* (prophecy after the fact), and note the Gospel's emphasis on Jewish temple practices that would have diminished relevance after 70 CE. The majority of critical scholars date Matthew between 80-95 CE, arguing that: (1) The Gospel reflects the final separation between church and synagogue occurring around 85-90 CE; (2) Matthew's use of Mark (typically dated around 70 CE) as a source requires a later date; (3) The description of Jerusalem's destruction in [Matthew 22:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#7) appears to reflect knowledge of the actual historical event in 70 CE. A minority of scholars (including N.T. Wright, John Wenham, and John A.T. Robinson) challenge late dating, arguing that evidence for Markan priority is not conclusive, that Matthew could date to the 40s-50s, and that the supposed "later" concerns actually reflect first-generation Jewish-Christian tensions.

**Compositional Process and Sources**: Beyond the question of final authorship, scholars debate Matthew's compositional process. The prevailing "Two-Source Hypothesis" proposes that Matthew used two primary sources: Mark's Gospel and a hypothetical sayings source designated "Q" (from German *Quelle*, "source"), shared with Luke but not found in Mark. Additionally, Matthew contains material unique to this Gospel (designated "M"), including the infancy narrative ([Matthew 1-2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1)), several parables (the weeds, the hidden treasure, the pearl of great value, the net, the unforgiving servant, the workers in the vineyard, the two sons, the wedding feast, the ten virgins, the talents, the sheep and the goats), and portions of the Sermon on the Mount. Whether "M" represents written sources, oral tradition, or the author's own composition remains debated. Some scholars (particularly advocates of Matthean priority like the Griesbach hypothesis) argue that Mark used Matthew, not vice versa, thus eliminating the primary argument against apostolic authorship.

**Conclusion on Authorship**: The authorship question ultimately divides along methodological lines. Those who grant substantial weight to early church testimony and allow for the possibility of eyewitness authorship despite use of written sources tend to affirm traditional Matthean authorship. Those who prioritize internal literary and historical evidence, assuming redactional activity and later dating, lean toward anonymous authorship by a Jewish-Christian scribe writing for a specific community context. Both positions acknowledge that the Gospel presents itself as authoritative apostolic testimony about Jesus Christ, and both traditions affirm its inspiration and canonical status regardless of the specific identity of the human author. The early church's universal attribution to Matthew, preserved in all manuscript traditions, testifies to the church's conviction that this Gospel authentically represents Matthew's testimony—whether through direct composition, superintendence of a scribe, or preservation of distinctly Matthean source material that formed the Gospel's foundation.

## Historical Environment

The Gospel of Matthew emerged during a critical period of transition for both Judaism and the nascent Christian movement. Understanding the historical, social, and religious environment that shaped this Gospel is essential for grasping its distinctive emphases and theological concerns.

**The Judean-Roman Context**: Matthew's Gospel is set during the final years of the Second Temple period, when Palestine existed under Roman occupation. The narrative opens during the reign of Herod the Great (37-4 BCE), the Idumean client-king appointed by Rome ([Matthew 2:1-22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#1)). Herod's paranoid brutality—exemplified in the massacre of Bethlehem's infants ([Matthew 2:16-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#16))—illustrates the oppressive political environment into which Jesus was born. Following Herod's death, Palestine was divided among his sons: Archelaus ruled Judea, Samaria, and Idumea (4 BCE - 6 CE, [Matthew 2:22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#22)); Herod Antipas governed Galilee and Perea (4 BCE - 39 CE, appearing in [Matthew 14:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#1) regarding John the Baptist's execution); and Philip ruled territories northeast of Galilee. After Archelaus's removal, Judea came under direct Roman rule through prefects, most notoriously Pontius Pilate (26-36 CE), who appears prominently in the passion narrative ([Matthew 27:1-26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#1)).

**Jewish Religious and Social Structure**: First-century Judaism was characterized by diverse sects and movements, several of which appear in Matthew's narrative. The Pharisees, a lay movement emphasizing oral Torah and purity observance, receive extensive (often critical) attention throughout Matthew ([Matthew 3:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#7); [5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20); [9:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#11), [34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#34); [12:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#2), [14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#14), [24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#24), [38](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#38); [15:1-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#1); [16:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#1); [19:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#3); chapters [22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#1)). The Sadducees, representing the aristocratic priestly establishment centered in the Jerusalem temple, appear in debates about resurrection ([Matthew 3:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#7); [16:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#1); [22:23-33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#23)). The scribes (grammateis), experts in Jewish law, frequently appear alongside Pharisees as Jesus' opponents ([Matthew 5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20); [7:29](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#29); [9:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#3); [12:38](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#38); [15:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#1); [23:2-36](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#2)).

**Messianic Expectation and Political Hope**: First-century Judaism nurtured intense messianic expectations, anticipating God's intervention to deliver Israel from oppression and restore the Davidic kingdom. Various messianic models circulated: the royal warrior-messiah who would defeat Rome and establish Israel's political sovereignty; the priestly messiah who would purify temple worship; the prophetic messiah like Moses or Elijah who would lead a new exodus. Matthew deliberately engages these expectations, presenting Jesus as the Davidic Messiah ([Matthew 1:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1), [6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#6), [20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#20); [9:27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#27); [12:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#23); [15:22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#22); [20:30-31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#30); [21:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#9), [15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#15); [22:42-45](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#42)) while dramatically redefining messianic expectations through emphasis on suffering, service, and spiritual redemption rather than political revolution.

**The Composition Date Context**: If Matthew was composed in the 60s CE (traditional dating), the Gospel reflects the tense final decade before the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE), a period of escalating Jewish nationalism, Roman oppression, and internal Jewish conflicts. If composed in the 80s-90s CE (majority scholarly dating), the Gospel reflects the traumatic aftermath of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE, when the temple was burned, the sacrificial system ended, and Pharisaic Judaism reorganized at Yavneh (Jamnia) under Johanan ben Zakkai. This later dating context helps explain Matthew's polemical edge against the Pharisees—possibly reflecting conflict between the Matthean community and the emerging rabbinic Judaism that claimed exclusive legitimacy as Israel's authentic continuation.

**Geographic Setting**: Most scholars propose that Matthew was composed in or near Antioch in Syria (modern Antakya, Turkey), the third-largest city in the Roman Empire. Antioch hosted a substantial Jewish population and became a major center of early Christianity ([Acts 11:19-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/11#19); [13:1-3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/13#1); [15:22-35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/15#22); [Galatians 2:11-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/galatians/2#11)). The bilingual urban environment (Greek-speaking but with strong Jewish presence) fits Matthew's characteristics: Greek literary composition with thorough knowledge of Hebrew Scriptures, sensitivity to Jewish concerns while writing for a broader audience. Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35-107 CE) demonstrates early knowledge of Matthew's Gospel, supporting Syrian provenance.

**The Matthean Community's Social Location**: The Gospel reflects a community experiencing identity crisis and boundary definition. Internal evidence suggests a predominantly Jewish-Christian congregation that included both former Pharisees (possibly indicated by [Matthew 13:52](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#52): "every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven") and less observant Jews, along with God-fearing Gentiles. The community faced external pressure from the broader Jewish community, evident in references to "their synagogues" ([Matthew 4:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#23); [9:35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#35); [10:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#17); [12:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#9); [13:54](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#54))—linguistic distancing suggesting separation or expulsion. Jesus' warning that disciples will be "flogged in their synagogues" ([Matthew 10:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#17)) and "delivered up to councils" ([Matthew 10:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#17); [24:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#9)) likely reflects the community's lived experience of persecution.

**Literary and Liturgical Context**: The Gospel's careful literary structure—five major discourse sections ([5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#1), [10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#1), [13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#1), [18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#1), [24-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1)) each ending with the formulaic phrase "when Jesus had finished these sayings" (7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1)—suggests composition for liturgical reading and catechetical instruction. The Gospel served not merely as historical record but as authoritative teaching document for Christian community formation. The emphasis on church discipline ([Matthew 18:15-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#15)), the Lord's Prayer ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#9)), and baptismal formula ([Matthew 28:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#19)) indicate the Gospel's liturgical function.

This historical environment—characterized by Roman political oppression, diverse Jewish sectarian movements, intense messianic expectation, temple-centered religious life (or its traumatic absence after 70 CE), urban bilingual culture, and emerging Jewish-Christian identity negotiations—shaped Matthew's distinctive portrayal of Jesus as the Jewish Messiah whose kingdom transcends and fulfills all previous covenantal expectations while opening salvation to all nations.

## Purpose

The Gospel of Matthew serves multiple interconnected purposes, all oriented toward demonstrating that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecy and establishes God's kingdom. Understanding these purposes illuminates the Gospel's distinctive emphases and theological contributions.

**Proving Jesus is the Jewish Messiah**: Matthew's primary purpose is establishing Jesus' messianic identity for a Jewish audience. The Gospel opens with a genealogy tracing Jesus' lineage through David to Abraham ([Matthew 1:1-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1)), immediately positioning Him within Israel's covenantal history. The title "son of David" appears throughout ([Matthew 1:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1), [20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#20); [9:27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#27); [12:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#23); [15:22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#22); [20:30-31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#30); [21:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#9), [15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#15); [22:42](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#42)), emphasizing Jesus' royal messianic credentials. Matthew employs extensive Old Testament quotations—more than any other Gospel, with approximately 60 citations—to demonstrate prophetic fulfillment.

**Fulfillment Formula Quotations**: Matthew uniquely employs "fulfillment citations" (appearing 10-14 times depending on scholarly count) with formulaic introductions like "this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet." Key examples include: [Matthew 1:22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#22) (virgin birth fulfilling [Isaiah 7:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/7#14)); [Matthew 2:5-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#5) (Bethlehem birth fulfilling [Micah 5:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/micah/5#2)); [Matthew 2:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#15) (return from Egypt fulfilling [Hosea 11:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/hosea/11#1)); [Matthew 2:17-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#17) (Herod's infanticide fulfilling [Jeremiah 31:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/31#15)); [Matthew 4:14-16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#14) (Galilean ministry fulfilling [Isaiah 9:1-2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/9#1)); [Matthew 8:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#17) (healing ministry fulfilling [Isaiah 53:4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/53#4)); [Matthew 12:17-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#17) (servant ministry fulfilling [Isaiah 42:1-4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/42#1)); [Matthew 13:35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#35) (parabolic teaching fulfilling [Psalm 78:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/psalms/78#2)); [Matthew 21:4-5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#4) (triumphal entry fulfilling [Zechariah 9:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/9#9)); [Matthew 27:9-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#9) (thirty pieces of silver fulfilling [Zechariah 11:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/11#12)). These citations demonstrate Matthew's theological conviction that Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection represent the climactic fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes revealed in Scripture.

**Proclaiming the Kingdom of Heaven**: Matthew emphasizes "the kingdom of heaven" (used 32 times, unique to this Gospel) as Jesus' central message. From Jesus' inaugural proclamation—"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" ([Matthew 4:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#17))—through the parables of the kingdom ([Matthew 13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#1)) to the eschatological discourse ([Matthew 24-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1)), the Gospel presents Jesus as the King who inaugurates God's reign. The kingdom teaching redefines Jewish messianic expectations: the kingdom arrives not through military conquest but through Jesus' authoritative teaching, miraculous signs, sacrificial death, and resurrection. Entry into the kingdom requires repentance, faith, and righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees ([Matthew 5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20)).

**Providing Catechetical Instruction**: Matthew's careful literary structure serves catechetical purposes. The five major discourses—Sermon on the Mount ([5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#1)), Mission Discourse ([10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#1)), Parables Discourse ([13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#1)), Community Discourse ([18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#1)), and Eschatological Discourse ([24-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1))—provide systematic teaching for Christian community formation. These discourses address ethics (5-7), mission (10), kingdom mysteries (13), church discipline (18), and eschatology (24-25), equipping believers for faithful discipleship.

**Establishing Church Identity and Practice**: Matthew is the only Gospel to use the term "church" (ekklēsia, [Matthew 16:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#18); [18:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#17)), indicating concern for community formation. Jesus' promise to Peter—"on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" ([Matthew 16:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#18))—establishes the church's foundation and invincibility. The community discourse ([Matthew 18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#1)) provides procedures for conflict resolution, church discipline, and restoration, emphasizing humility, forgiveness, and communal authority. The Great Commission ([Matthew 28:18-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#18)) defines the church's mission: making disciples of all nations through baptism and teaching.

**Defending Against Jewish Objections**: Matthew addresses Jewish rejection of Jesus' messianic claims through careful argumentation. The Gospel counters objections that the Messiah would not come from Galilee ([Matthew 4:12-16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#12) fulfills [Isaiah 9:1-2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/9#1)), that He would not associate with sinners (Jesus explicitly came to call sinners, [Matthew 9:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#13)), that He would not violate Sabbath (Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath, [Matthew 12:8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#8)), and that His disciples would not neglect ritual purity (true defilement comes from the heart, [Matthew 15:10-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#10)). The Gospel also addresses the charge that disciples stole Jesus' body ([Matthew 28:11-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#11)), showing this as a deliberately fabricated lie.

**Addressing the Gentile Mission**: While emphasizing Jesus' Jewish identity, Matthew also prepares for the Gentile mission. The magi from the east worship the newborn king ([Matthew 2:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#1)); the centurion demonstrates greater faith than any in Israel ([Matthew 8:5-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#5)); the Canaanite woman's persistent faith receives commendation ([Matthew 15:21-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#21)); and Jesus predicts that "many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness" ([Matthew 8:11-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#11)). The Great Commission explicitly sends disciples to "all nations" ([Matthew 28:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#19)), universalizing salvation while maintaining continuity with Israel's covenantal history.

**Correcting False Righteousness**: A persistent theme is contrasting authentic righteousness with the hypocritical righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. Jesus' teaching, "unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20)), introduces the Sermon on the Mount's radical ethical demands. The extended woe discourse against the Pharisees ([Matthew 23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#1)) exposes their hypocrisy: they teach but do not practice ([23:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#3)), they burden others while avoiding burdens themselves ([23:4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#4)), they perform religious acts for human praise ([23:5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#5)), they prevent others from entering the kingdom ([23:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#13)), and they focus on externals while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness ([23:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#23)).

In summary, Matthew's purpose is multifaceted: demonstrating Jesus as the Jewish Messiah through fulfillment of Scripture, proclaiming the kingdom of heaven, providing systematic teaching for Christian community formation, establishing church identity and practice, defending against Jewish objections, preparing for the Gentile mission, and contrasting authentic righteousness with religious hypocrisy. All purposes converge in presenting Jesus as the authoritative interpreter of Torah, the inaugurator of God's kingdom, and the foundation of the church sent to disciple all nations.

## Cross-References

The Gospel of Matthew contains extensive cross-references both to the Old Testament and to other New Testament writings. Matthew quotes or alludes to the Hebrew Scriptures more than any other Gospel, with approximately 60 direct citations and numerous additional allusions, establishing Jesus' ministry as the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan revealed through the prophets.

**Old Testament Fulfillment Quotations**: Matthew employs distinctive "fulfillment formula" citations (10-14 occurrences) that explicitly identify prophetic fulfillment. [Matthew 1:22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#22) cites [Isaiah 7:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/7#14) regarding the virgin birth: "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel."

**Synoptic Gospel Relationships**: Matthew shares extensive material with Mark and Luke. Approximately 90% of Mark's content appears in Matthew, typically with stylistic improvements and additional material. The triple tradition (material in all three Synoptics) includes most major pericopes: Jesus' baptism ([Mark 1:9-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/1#9); [Luke 3:21-22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/3#21); [Matthew 3:13-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#13)), the temptation ([Mark 1:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/1#12); [Luke 4:1-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/4#1); [Matthew 4:1-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#1)), Peter's confession ([Mark 8:27-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/8#27); [Luke 9:18-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/9#18); [Matthew 16:13-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#13)), the Transfiguration ([Mark 9:2-8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/9#2); [Luke 9:28-36](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/9#28); [Matthew 17:1-8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#1)), and the passion narrative ([Mark 14-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/14#1); [Luke 22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/22#1); [Matthew 26-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#1)).

Matthew and Luke share approximately 235 verses not found in Mark, traditionally attributed to the hypothetical "Q" source. This material includes the Beatitudes ([Matthew 5:3-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#3); [Luke 6:20-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/6#20)), the Lord's Prayer ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#9); [Luke 11:2-4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/11#2)), the centurion's faith ([Matthew 8:5-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#5); [Luke 7:1-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/7#1)), John's question about Jesus ([Matthew 11:2-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#2); [Luke 7:18-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/7#18)), and various sayings about discipleship, judgment, and the kingdom.

**Johannine Connections**: While John's Gospel follows different structure and theology, several connections exist. Both Matthew and John record Jesus' walking on water ([Matthew 14:22-33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#22); [John 6:16-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/6#16)), though with different emphases. Both include Peter's confession of Jesus as Messiah ([Matthew 16:13-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#13); [John 6:68-69](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/6#68)), the triumphal entry ([Matthew 21:1-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#1); [John 12:12-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/12#12)), and extensive passion material ([Matthew 26-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#1); [John 18-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/18#1)).

**Acts and Pauline Corpus**: [Acts 1:18-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/1#18) provides an alternative account of Judas' death, complementing [Matthew 27:3-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#3). Peter's Pentecost sermon in [Acts 2:34-35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/2#34) quotes the same [Psalm 110:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/psalms/110#1) that Jesus cites in [Matthew 22:44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#44). Paul's teaching on marriage and divorce in [1 Corinthians 7:10-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-corinthians/7#10) references Jesus' teaching found in [Matthew 5:32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#32) and [19:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#9). Paul's discussion of the Lord's Supper in [1 Corinthians 11:23-26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-corinthians/11#23) parallels Matthew's institution narrative in [Matthew 26:26-29](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#26). The Great Commission's baptismal formula in [Matthew 28:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#19) finds echoes throughout Acts and the epistles.

**James and General Epistles**: The Epistle of James shows remarkable affinity with Matthew's Sermon on the Mount. [James 1:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/1#2) echoes [Matthew 5:11-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#11) on rejoicing in trials. [James 1:4-5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/1#4) parallels [Matthew 5:48](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#48) on perfection. [James 1:22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/1#22) reflects [Matthew 7:21-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#21) on doing, not just hearing. [James 2:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/2#13) echoes [Matthew 5:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#7) and [6:14-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#14) on mercy and forgiveness. [James 4:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/4#10) parallels [Matthew 23:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#12) on humility and exaltation. [James 5:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/james/5#12) closely follows [Matthew 5:34-37](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#34) on not swearing oaths.

[1 Peter 2:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-peter/2#12) echoes [Matthew 5:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#16) about good works glorifying God. [1 Peter 3:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-peter/3#9) reflects [Matthew 5:38-48](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#38) on not repaying evil for evil. [1 Peter 3:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-peter/3#14) alludes to [Matthew 5:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#10) regarding blessing in persecution. [1 Peter 4:12-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1-peter/4#12) parallels [Matthew 5:11-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#11) on rejoicing in suffering for righteousness.

**Revelation**: The apocalyptic discourse in [Matthew 24-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1) shares themes and imagery with Revelation, particularly regarding tribulation, cosmic signs, the Son of Man's coming in glory, and final judgment. [Matthew 24:30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#30) describing the Son of Man coming on clouds connects with [Revelation 1:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/revelation/1#7). The judgment scene in [Matthew 25:31-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#31) anticipates the great white throne judgment in [Revelation 20:11-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/revelation/20#11).

This extensive network of cross-references demonstrates Matthew's role as the bridge between Old and New Testaments, anchoring Jesus' ministry firmly in Israel's scriptural heritage while establishing the foundation for Christian theology developed throughout the New Testament corpus.

## Canonical Status

The Gospel of Matthew has enjoyed uncontested canonical status since the earliest period of church history. Among the four canonical Gospels, Matthew appears to have achieved widespread recognition and liturgical use earlier than any other, making it the most frequently cited Gospel in early Christian literature.

**Early Patristic Attestation**: The earliest explicit testimony to Matthew's Gospel comes from Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60-130 CE), whose statement preserved by Eusebius identifies Matthew as the author: "Matthew compiled the Oracles in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well as he could." Whether Papias refers to canonical Greek Matthew or an earlier Aramaic source remains debated, but his testimony establishes early recognition of Matthean material as authoritative.

Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35-107 CE) demonstrates knowledge of Matthew's Gospel in his letters written around 107-110 CE. His Epistle to the Smyrnaeans 1:1 alludes to [Matthew 3:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#15), and Epistle to Polycarp 2:2 echoes [Matthew 10:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#16) ("Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves"). The Didache (c. 70-110 CE), an early Christian manual, quotes extensively from Matthew, including the Lord's Prayer ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#9)) in Didache 8:2 and baptismal instructions referencing [Matthew 28:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#19) in Didache 7:1.

Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 CE) refers to the Gospels as "memoirs of the apostles" in his First Apology (c. 155-157 CE) and Dialogue with Trypho, citing material from Matthew more than any other Gospel. Though Justin rarely names the Gospels explicitly, his quotations demonstrate Matthew's authoritative status in mid-second-century Rome.

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 CE), writing around 180 CE in Against Heresies 3.1.1, provides crucial testimony: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church." Irenaeus explicitly affirms the fourfold Gospel canon, arguing that just as there are four winds and four corners of the earth, so there must be four Gospels (Against Heresies 3.11.8). His testimony establishes that by 180 CE, Matthew held undisputed place among the four canonical Gospels.

**Manuscript Evidence**: Matthew appears in all major early manuscripts of the New Testament. Papyrus fragments include P1 (3rd century, containing portions of Matthew 1), P45 (early 3rd century, containing portions of all four Gospels including Matthew), P53 (3rd century, Matthew 26), P64+67 (c. 200 CE, Matthew 3, 5, 26), P70 (3rd century, Matthew 2-3, 11-12, 24), P77 (late 2nd/early 3rd century, Matthew 23), and P104 (2nd century, Matthew 21). The second-century dating of some fragments (particularly P64+67 and P104) demonstrates Matthew's circulation within 100 years of composition.

The great uncial codices all include Matthew in the first position among the Gospels: Codex Sinaiticus (4th century, א/01), Codex Vaticanus (4th century, B/03), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century, A/02), Codex Bezae (5th century, D/05), and Codex Washingtonianus (5th century, W/032). Matthew's consistent placement first in these manuscripts reflects early tradition regarding Gospel order, likely based on its perceived apostolic authorship and comprehensive presentation of Jesus' teaching.

**Early Canonical Lists**: Matthew appears in every known early Christian canonical list. The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170-200 CE), though damaged at its beginning, includes reference to the Gospels and explicitly discusses the fourfold Gospel canon. Origen of Alexandria (c. 185-254 CE) lists Matthew first among the four Gospels in his Commentary on Matthew and Homilies, treating it as undisputed Scripture. Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260-339 CE) in his Ecclesiastical History 3.25.1-7 places Matthew among the "recognized books" (homologoumena) that were universally accepted, contrasting these with disputed books (antilegomena).

Athanasius' 39th Festal Letter (367 CE) provides the earliest complete list of the 27-book New Testament canon, with Matthew listed first among the Gospels. The councils of Hippo (393 CE) and Carthage (397 CE, 419 CE) officially recognized the 27-book New Testament canon including Matthew. Jerome's Vulgate (late 4th/early 5th century) and Augustine's writings (late 4th/early 5th century) both affirm Matthew's canonical status without qualification.

**Liturgical Usage**: Matthew's Gospel achieved early prominence in Christian liturgy. Its comprehensive presentation of Jesus' teaching, particularly the Sermon on the Mount ([Matthew 5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#1)), made it ideally suited for catechetical instruction. The Lord's Prayer from [Matthew 6:9-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#9) became standard in Christian worship. The Great Commission ([Matthew 28:18-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#18)) provided the baptismal formula. Early church orders and liturgical texts quote Matthew more frequently than other Gospels, indicating its central role in worship and instruction.

The church fathers' commentaries demonstrate Matthew's canonical authority. Origen wrote the first extensive Gospel commentary on Matthew (c. 246-248 CE). John Chrysostom's Homilies on Matthew (c. 390 CE) provided 90 sermons expounding the entire Gospel. Jerome, Augustine, and virtually every major patristic writer produced Matthew commentaries or extensively cited it, treating the Gospel as divinely inspired Scripture.

**No Canonical Disputes**: Unlike certain New Testament books that faced periods of questioning (such as Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Jude, and Revelation), Matthew never experienced canonical dispute. No orthodox Christian group ever questioned its authority. Even heretical groups like the Ebionites, who rejected much of the New Testament, accepted Matthew (though in modified form). Marcion (c. 85-160 CE), who rejected the Old Testament and most of the New Testament, included a Gospel in his canon (a redacted Luke), implicitly acknowledging Gospel authority, and his opponents used Matthew against him.

**Relationship to the Four-Gospel Canon**: By the mid-to-late second century, the fourfold Gospel canon (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) had achieved universal recognition in orthodox Christianity. Irenaeus' defense of exactly four Gospels (Against Heresies 3.11.8) demonstrates this was not arbitrary but based on apostolic tradition and the Gospels' complementary witness to Christ. Tatian's Diatessaron (c. 160-175 CE), a harmony of the four Gospels, presupposes their recognized authority. The

 fourfold canon resisted both reductionist tendencies (like Marcion's single Gospel) and expansionist tendencies (rejecting apocryphal gospels like the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, or Infancy Gospel of Thomas).

**Eastern and Western Agreement**: Both Eastern and Western churches universally accepted Matthew without variation. Greek-speaking Eastern churches, Latin-speaking Western churches, Syriac-speaking churches (as evidenced by the Old Syriac and Peshitta versions), Coptic churches, Ethiopian churches, Armenian churches, and Georgian churches all included Matthew in their canonical collections. This geographic and linguistic unanimity demonstrates that Matthew's canonical status did not depend on regional tradition but on universal apostolic recognition.

**Reformers' Affirmation**: The Protestant Reformers unanimously affirmed Matthew's canonical authority. Martin Luther's German translation (1522) included Matthew without question. John Calvin's Commentary on a Harmony of the Evangelists (1555) treated Matthew as inspired Scripture. The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) listed Matthew among the canonical books "given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life." All major Protestant confessions affirm Matthew's place in the New Testament canon.

**Modern Ecumenical Consensus**: Despite scholarly debates about authorship and dating, all major Christian traditions—Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Protestant—unanimously recognize Matthew's canonical status. The Gospel appears in every Christian Bible worldwide, translated into thousands of languages. Ecumenical organizations and interdenominational translations consistently include Matthew as foundational Scripture.

In summary, Matthew's canonical status rests on: (1) earliest patristic attestation from the late first/early second century; (2) universal manuscript evidence from the second century onward; (3) inclusion in every early canonical list; (4) extensive liturgical usage demonstrating practical recognition; (5) complete absence of canonical disputes; (6) central role in the universally accepted fourfold Gospel canon; (7) unanimous Eastern and Western church recognition; (8) Reformers' affirmation; and (9) modern ecumenical consensus. Matthew stands among the most firmly established books in the Christian canon.

## Summary

The Gospel of Matthew presents Jesus of Nazareth as the Jewish Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecy, establishes God's kingdom, and sends His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The Gospel's 28 chapters systematically demonstrate Jesus' identity through genealogy, teaching, miracles, death, resurrection, and commission.

**Chapters 1-2: The Messiah's Birth and Infancy**: Matthew opens with Jesus' genealogy tracing His lineage through David to Abraham ([Matthew 1:1-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1)), establishing His legal right to David's throne. The genealogy emphasizes Jesus as "the Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" ([Matthew 1:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1)), immediately positioning Him within Israel's covenantal history. The virgin birth fulfills [Isaiah 7:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/7#14): "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" ([Matthew 1:22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#22)). An angel commands Joseph: "you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins" ([Matthew 1:21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#21)).

Magi from the east worship the newborn king ([Matthew 2:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#1)), while Herod's paranoid massacre of Bethlehem's infants ([Matthew 2:16-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#16)) fulfills [Jeremiah 31:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/31#15). The family's flight to and return from Egypt fulfills [Hosea 11:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/hosea/11#1): "Out of Egypt I called my son" ([Matthew 2:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#15)).

**Chapters 3-4: Preparation and Temptation**: John the Baptist prepares the way, proclaiming, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" ([Matthew 3:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#2)), fulfilling [Isaiah 40:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/40#3). At Jesus' baptism, the heavens open and God declares, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased" ([Matthew 3:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/3#17)). The Spirit leads Jesus into the wilderness where Satan tempts Him ([Matthew 4:1-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#1)). Jesus defeats each temptation with Scripture, commanding Satan, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" ([Matthew 4:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#10), quoting [Deuteronomy 6:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/deuteronomy/6#13)).

Jesus begins His Galilean ministry, proclaiming, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" ([Matthew 4:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#17)). He calls His first disciples with the command, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" ([Matthew 4:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#19)).

**Chapters 5-7: The Sermon on the Mount**: Jesus delivers His first major discourse, presenting the kingdom's ethics and righteousness. The Beatitudes pronounce blessings: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 5:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#3)); "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" ([5:4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#4)); through "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" ([5:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#10)). Jesus declares His disciples to be "the salt of the earth" and "the light of the world" ([Matthew 5:13-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#13)), commanding them to "let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven" ([Matthew 5:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#16)).

Jesus teaches that He came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets ([Matthew 5:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#17)), establishing that "unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20)). Six antitheses demonstrate kingdom ethics: on murder ([5:21-26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#21)), adultery ([5:27-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#27)), divorce ([5:31-32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#31)), oaths ([5:33-37](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#33)), retaliation ([5:38-42](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#38)), and love for enemies ([5:43-48](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#43)). Jesus commands, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" ([Matthew 5:44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#44)), concluding, "You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" ([Matthew 5:48](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#48)).

Chapter 6 addresses authentic piety: giving alms, praying, and fasting in secret rather than for human praise ([Matthew 6:1-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#1)). Jesus teaches the Lord's Prayer: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven..." ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#9)). He commands, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth...but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" ([Matthew 6:19-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#19)), teaching that "you cannot serve God and money" ([Matthew 6:24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#24)). Jesus addresses anxiety: "do not be anxious about your life" ([Matthew 6:25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#25)), commanding instead, "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness" ([Matthew 6:33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#33)).

Chapter 7 warns against judging others ([7:1-5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#1)), teaches prayer persistence ([7:7-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#7)), and presents the Golden Rule: "whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets" ([Matthew 7:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#12)). Jesus commands, "Enter by the narrow gate" ([Matthew 7:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#13)), warning that "the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many" ([Matthew 7:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#13)). He warns against false prophets ([7:15-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#15)) and declares that many will claim, "Lord, Lord," but only "the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" will enter the kingdom ([Matthew 7:21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#21)). The discourse concludes with the parable of the wise and foolish builders ([7:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#24)), emphasizing that hearing and doing Jesus' words provides secure foundation.

**Chapters 8-9: Mighty Works and Growing Opposition**: Jesus demonstrates His authority through ten miracles: cleansing a leper ([8:1-4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#1)), healing the centurion's servant ([8:5-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#5)), healing Peter's mother-in-law and many others ([8:14-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#14)), calming the storm ([8:23-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#23)), casting out demons from the Gadarene demoniacs ([8:28-34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#28)), healing a paralytic ([9:1-8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#1)), raising Jairus' daughter ([9:18-26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#18)), healing the woman with a discharge of blood ([9:20-22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#20)), healing two blind men ([9:27-31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#27)), and healing a mute demoniac ([9:32-34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#32)).

Jesus calls Matthew the tax collector with the simple command, "Follow me" ([Matthew 9:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#9)). When Pharisees question His association with sinners, Jesus declares, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" ([Matthew 9:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#12)), commanding them, "Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners" ([Matthew 9:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/9#13), quoting [Hosea 6:6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/hosea/6#6)).

**Chapter 10: The Mission Discourse**: Jesus commissions the Twelve, giving them "authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction" ([Matthew 10:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#1)). He commands them: "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" ([Matthew 10:5-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#5)). Their message: "The kingdom of heaven is at hand" ([Matthew 10:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#7)). Jesus instructs, "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay" ([Matthew 10:8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#8)).

Jesus warns of coming persecution: "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" ([Matthew 10:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#16)). He promises, "do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you" ([Matthew 10:19-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#19)). Jesus declares, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell" ([Matthew 10:28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#28)). He warns, "whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven" ([Matthew 10:33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#33)), yet promises, "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me" ([Matthew 10:40](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#40)).

**Chapters 11-12: Mounting Opposition**: When John sends disciples asking if Jesus is "the one who is to come," Jesus responds by pointing to His works fulfilling Isaiah's prophecies ([Matthew 11:2-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#2)). Jesus testifies about John, declaring, "among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist" ([Matthew 11:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#11)), yet "the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he" ([Matthew 11:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#11)).

Jesus pronounces woes on unrepentant cities ([Matthew 11:20-24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#20)), then issues His gracious invitation: "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" ([Matthew 11:28-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#28)).

Conflict escalates over Sabbath observance ([Matthew 12:1-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#1)). Jesus declares, "the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath" ([Matthew 12:8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#8)). When Pharisees accuse Him of casting out demons by Beelzebul, Jesus warns against blasphemy of the Holy Spirit: "whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come" ([Matthew 12:32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#32)). He teaches that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" ([Matthew 12:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#34)), warning, "on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak" ([Matthew 12:36](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#36)).

**Chapter 13: The Parables Discourse**: Jesus presents seven parables revealing kingdom mysteries. The parable of the sower ([13:1-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#1)) teaches that the word produces varying results based on receptivity. Jesus explains that He speaks in parables to reveal truth to disciples while concealing it from hard-hearted hearers ([Matthew 13:10-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#10)). The parables of the weeds ([13:24-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#24), explained in [13:36-43](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#36)), the mustard seed ([13:31-32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#31)), and the leaven ([13:33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#33)) illustrate the kingdom's nature and growth. The parables of the hidden treasure ([13:44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#44)) and the pearl of great value ([13:45-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#45)) demonstrate the kingdom's surpassing worth. The parable of the net ([13:47-50](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#47)) depicts final judgment separating righteous from wicked.

**Chapters 14-17: Miracles and Revelation**: John the Baptist's beheading ([14:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#1)) demonstrates opposition's intensity. Jesus feeds five thousand ([14:13-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#13)), walks on water ([14:22-33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#22)), and heals many ([14:34-36](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#34)). Conflict with Pharisees continues over tradition ([15:1-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#1)). Jesus teaches, "it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person" ([Matthew 15:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#11)).

The Canaanite woman's persistent faith receives commendation ([15:21-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#21)). Jesus feeds four thousand ([15:32-39](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/15#32)) and warns against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ([16:5-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#5)).

At Caesarea Philippi, Peter confesses, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" ([Matthew 16:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#16)). Jesus responds, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 16:17-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#17)). Jesus begins predicting His death and resurrection ([16:21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#21)), commanding disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" ([Matthew 16:24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#24)).

The Transfiguration ([17:1-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#1)) reveals Jesus' glory as God declares, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him" ([Matthew 17:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#5)). Jesus heals an epileptic boy ([17:14-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#14)), again predicts His death ([17:22-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#22)), and provides temple tax through miraculous means ([17:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#24)).

**Chapter 18: The Community Discourse**: Jesus teaches kingdom humility: "unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 18:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#3)). He warns, "whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea" ([Matthew 18:6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#6)). The parable of the lost sheep ([18:10-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#10)) demonstrates God's concern for each believer.

Jesus establishes church discipline procedures ([18:15-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#15)), promising, "where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them" ([Matthew 18:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#20)). He teaches unlimited forgiveness through the parable of the unforgiving servant ([18:21-35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#21)), warning that God will not forgive those who refuse to forgive others ([Matthew 18:35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#35)).

**Chapters 19-23: Journey to Jerusalem and Confrontation**: Jesus teaches God's design for marriage: "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" ([Matthew 19:4-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#4), quoting [Genesis 1:27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/genesis/1#27) and [2:24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/genesis/2#24)). He blesses children ([19:13-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#13)) and teaches the rich young ruler about eternal life ([19:16-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#16)), declaring, "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God" ([Matthew 19:24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#24)).

The parable of the workers in the vineyard ([20:1-16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#1)) teaches kingdom grace. Jesus predicts His death a third time ([20:17-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#17)) and teaches servant leadership: "whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" ([Matthew 20:26-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#26)).

Jesus enters Jerusalem triumphantly ([21:1-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#1)), fulfilling [Zechariah 9:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/9#9). He cleanses the temple, declaring, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers" ([Matthew 21:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#13), quoting [Isaiah 56:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/56#7) and [Jeremiah 7:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/7#11)). Through parables—the two sons ([21:28-32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#28)), the wicked tenants ([21:33-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#33)), and the wedding feast ([22:1-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#1))—Jesus pronounces judgment on Israel's leaders while warning that "many are called, but few are chosen" ([Matthew 22:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#14)).

Religious leaders test Jesus with questions about taxes ([22:15-22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#15)), resurrection ([22:23-33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#23)), and the greatest commandment ([22:34-40](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#34)). Jesus summarizes the Law: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" ([Matthew 22:37-40](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/22#37), quoting [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/deuteronomy/6#5) and [Leviticus 19:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/leviticus/19#18)).

Matthew 23 contains Jesus' extensive denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, pronouncing seven woes against their hypocrisy. Jesus condemns them for teaching but not practicing ([23:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#3)), burdening others while avoiding burdens ([23:4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#4)), performing religious acts for praise ([23:5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#5)), shutting the kingdom against people ([23:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#13)), making converts twice the sons of hell ([23:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#15)), neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness while tithing minutiae ([23:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#23)), appearing righteous outwardly while full of hypocrisy inwardly ([23:27-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#27)), and persecuting prophets ([23:29-36](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#29)). Jesus laments over Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!" ([Matthew 23:37](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#37)).

**Chapters 24-25: The Eschatological Discourse**: Jesus predicts the temple's destruction ([24:1-2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1)) and describes signs preceding His return: false messiahs ([24:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#5), [11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#11), [24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#24)), wars ([24:6-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#6)), famines and earthquakes ([24:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#7)), persecution ([24:9-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#9)), and gospel proclamation to all nations ([24:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#14)). Jesus describes the great tribulation ([24:15-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#15)) and His glorious return: "they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" ([Matthew 24:30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#30)). He commands watchfulness: "stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming" ([Matthew 24:42](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#42)).

Three parables emphasize readiness: the faithful and wise servant ([24:45-51](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#45)), the ten virgins ([25:1-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#1)), and the talents ([25:14-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#14)). The judgment scene ([25:31-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#31)) depicts the Son of Man separating sheep from goats based on treatment of "the least of these." The King declares, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" ([Matthew 25:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#34)) to those who fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, and visited the sick and imprisoned. To the cursed He says, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" ([Matthew 25:41](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#41)), concluding, "these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" ([Matthew 25:46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#46)).

**Chapters 26-27: Passion and Death**: Jewish leaders plot Jesus' death ([26:1-5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#1)). A woman anoints Jesus at Bethany ([26:6-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#6)); Judas agrees to betray Him for thirty pieces of silver ([26:14-16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#14)). At the Last Supper, Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body" ([Matthew 26:26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#26)) and "Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" ([Matthew 26:27-28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#27)).

In Gethsemane, Jesus prays, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will" ([Matthew 26:39](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#39)). Judas betrays Him with a kiss ([26:47-56](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#47)). Before the high priest, Jesus affirms His identity: "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" ([Matthew 26:64](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#64), referencing [Psalm 110:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/psalms/110#1) and [Daniel 7:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/daniel/7#13)). Peter denies Jesus three times ([26:69-75](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#69)).

Judas, filled with remorse, returns the thirty pieces of silver and hangs himself ([27:3-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#3)). Jesus stands before Pilate, who asks, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answers, "You have said so" ([Matthew 27:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#11)). The crowd chooses Barabbas over Jesus ([27:15-26](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#15)). Soldiers mock Jesus, placing a crown of thorns on His head and a reed in His hand, kneeling before Him saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" ([Matthew 27:27-31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#27)).

Jesus is crucified at Golgotha ([27:32-44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#32)). From the cross He cries, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" ([Matthew 27:46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#46), quoting [Psalm 22:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/psalms/22#1)). At His death, "the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split" ([Matthew 27:51](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#51)). The centurion declares, "Truly this was the Son of God!" ([Matthew 27:54](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#54)). Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus in his own new tomb ([27:57-61](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#57)). Religious leaders seal and guard the tomb ([27:62-66](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#62)).

**Chapter 28: Resurrection and Commission**: On the third day, an angel rolls back the stone, declaring to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, as he said" ([Matthew 28:5-6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#5)). The angel commands them, "go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead" ([Matthew 28:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#7)). Jesus appears to the women, greeting them and commanding, "go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me" ([Matthew 28:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#10)).

Guards report to the chief priests, who bribe them to spread the false story that disciples stole the body ([28:11-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#11)). The Gospel concludes with the Great Commission ([28:16-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#16)). Jesus declares, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" ([Matthew 28:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#18)), then commands His disciples: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" ([Matthew 28:19-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#19)). Jesus' final promise concludes the Gospel: "And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" ([Matthew 28:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#20)).

Throughout these 28 chapters, Matthew presents Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words carry divine authority, the miracle-working Messiah who demonstrates God's kingdom power, the suffering servant who gives His life as a ransom, and the risen Lord who commissions His church to disciple all nations. Every major teaching, command, and promise emphasizes Jesus' role as the fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes and the foundation of the new covenant community.

## Unique Teachings

The Gospel of Matthew contains several distinctive theological and literary contributions that either appear only in this Gospel or receive unique emphasis compared to the other three canonical Gospels. These unique elements establish Matthew's particular witness to Jesus Christ and demonstrate the Spirit's intention that each Gospel present complementary perspectives on the same Lord.

**The Phrase "Kingdom of Heaven"**: Matthew's most distinctive terminological contribution is the phrase "kingdom of heaven" (ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν), appearing 32 times throughout the Gospel. This phrase occurs nowhere in Mark, Luke, or John, though Matthew also uses "kingdom of God" five times ([Matthew 12:28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/12#28); [19:24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#24); [21:31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#31), [43](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#43)). Scholars debate whether "kingdom of heaven" represents Jewish circumlocution avoiding the divine name or carries distinct theological meaning. Regardless, this distinctive phrase characterizes Matthew's Gospel, appearing in key passages: Jesus' proclamation "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" ([Matthew 4:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/4#17)), the Beatitudes ([Matthew 5:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#3), [10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#10)), entrance requirements ([Matthew 5:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#20); [7:21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#21); [18:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#3); [19:14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#14)), and the parables ([Matthew 13:11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#11), [24](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#24), [31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#31), [33](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#33), [44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#44), [45](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#45), [47](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#47), [52](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#52)).

**The Five-Discourse Structure**: Matthew uniquely organizes Jesus' teaching into five major discourses, each concluded with the formulaic phrase "when Jesus had finished these sayings" (ὅτε ἐτέλεσεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς) or similar: [Matthew 7:28](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#28), [11:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/11#1), [13:53](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#53), [19:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/19#1), [26:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#1). These five discourses—Sermon on the Mount ([5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#1)), Mission ([10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/10#1)), Parables ([13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#1)), Community ([18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#1)), and Eschatological ([24-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/24#1))—parallel the five books of Moses (Pentateuch), presenting Jesus as the new Moses who authoritatively interprets and fulfills Torah. This structural pattern appears nowhere in the other Gospels and demonstrates Matthew's deliberate literary artistry and theological messaging.

**Unique Parables**: Matthew contains several parables found in no other Gospel. The weeds among the wheat ([Matthew 13:24-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#24), [36-43](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#36)) teaches patient endurance until final judgment. The hidden treasure ([Matthew 13:44](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#44)) and the pearl of great value ([Matthew 13:45-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#45)) illustrate the kingdom's surpassing worth requiring total commitment. The net ([Matthew 13:47-50](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#47)) depicts final separation of righteous and wicked. The unforgiving servant ([Matthew 18:23-35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#23)) warns that refusal to forgive others results in divine judgment. The workers in the vineyard ([Matthew 20:1-16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/20#1)) demonstrates kingdom grace overturning human merit expectations. The two sons ([Matthew 21:28-32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#28)) contrasts verbal profession with actual obedience. The ten virgins ([Matthew 25:1-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#1)) emphasizes preparedness for Christ's return. The talents ([Matthew 25:14-30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#14)) teaches faithful stewardship. The sheep and goats judgment ([Matthew 25:31-46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/25#31)) depicts final separation based on treatment of "the least of these."

**The Only Gospel Using "Church" (Ekklēsia)**: Matthew uniquely employs the term "church" (ἐκκλησία) in the Gospels, appearing twice: Jesus' promise to Peter, "on this rock I will build my church" ([Matthew 16:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#18)), and instructions for church discipline, "tell it to the church" ([Matthew 18:17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/18#17), twice). This terminological distinctiveness indicates Matthew's particular concern for ecclesiology and community formation, providing foundational teaching for how the messianic community should function after Jesus' ascension.

**The Sermon on the Mount**: While Luke contains a shorter "Sermon on the Plain" ([Luke 6:20-49](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/6#20)), Matthew's Sermon on the Mount ([Matthew 5-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#1)) stands as the most comprehensive presentation of Jesus' ethical teaching. Unique elements include portions of the Beatitudes, the antitheses contrasting "you have heard...but I say to you" ([Matthew 5:21-48](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/5#21)), extensive teaching on piety ([Matthew 6:1-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#1)), material possessions and anxiety ([Matthew 6:19-34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#19)), and the parable of the wise and foolish builders ([Matthew 7:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/7#24)). The Sermon's programmatic placement at the beginning of Jesus' ministry establishes His teaching authority as the foundation for everything that follows.

**Peter's Keys of the Kingdom**: The promise to Peter in [Matthew 16:17-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#17) appears only in Matthew: "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." This unique logion addresses Peter's foundational role, the church's establishment, its invincibility against hell, and apostolic authority in binding and loosing. While disputed interpretatively (whether "this rock" refers to Peter personally, his confession, or Christ), the passage's exclusivity to Matthew demonstrates this Gospel's unique ecclesiological emphases.

**The Great Commission Formula**: While all Gospels end with resurrection appearances and commissioning, Matthew's version ([Matthew 28:18-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#18)) uniquely includes the Trinitarian baptismal formula—"baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"—and emphasizes teaching disciples "to observe all that I have commanded you." This comprehensive commission became the basis for Christian missionary practice and baptismal liturgy throughout church history. The promise "I am with you always, to the end of the age" ([Matthew 28:20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#20)) provides the Gospel's final word, bracketing with the opening "Immanuel" (God with us, [Matthew 1:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#23)).

**Fulfillment Quotations**: Matthew's distinctive use of fulfillment formula quotations ("this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet") appears nowhere else with such frequency or formulaic consistency. These citations demonstrate Matthew's unique emphasis on Jesus as the climactic fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, establishing continuity between the covenants while showing Jesus' ministry as the goal toward which Scripture pointed.

**Unique Infancy Narrative Details**: While both Matthew and Luke contain infancy narratives, Matthew's version includes unique elements: Joseph's perspective rather than Mary's, the magi's visit guided by the star ([Matthew 2:1-12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#1)), Herod's massacre of the innocents ([Matthew 2:16-18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#16)), and the flight to and return from Egypt ([Matthew 2:13-23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#13)). These details, each accompanied by fulfillment quotations, establish Jesus' royal messianic identity and position Him within Israel's exodus typology.

**The Transfiguration Cloud Voice**: While all Synoptics include the Transfiguration, only Matthew records the divine voice adding "listen to him" ([Matthew 17:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#5)), echoing [Deuteronomy 18:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/deuteronomy/18#15) about the prophet like Moses whom Israel must obey. This unique addition reinforces Matthew's presentation of Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words demand obedient response.

**Judas' Remorse and Death**: Matthew uniquely records Judas' remorse, his return of the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests, his suicide, and the priests' purchase of the potter's field with the blood money ([Matthew 27:3-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#3)). Acts provides a different account ([Acts 1:18-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/1#18)), but Matthew's version emphasizes fulfillment of prophecy ([Zechariah 11:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/11#12), attributed to Jeremiah in [Matthew 27:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#9)) and demonstrates the tragic consequences of betraying the Messiah.

**The Guard at the Tomb**: Only Matthew records that Jewish leaders requested Pilate to secure the tomb with guards ([Matthew 27:62-66](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#62)), the earthquake and angelic stone-rolling at the resurrection ([Matthew 28:2-4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#2)), and the guards' report to the chief priests followed by their being bribed to spread the false story that disciples stole the body ([Matthew 28:11-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#11)). These unique details address Jewish objections to the resurrection and demonstrate that Jesus' tomb was indeed empty.

**Saints Rising at Jesus' Death**: Matthew uniquely records that at Jesus' death, "the tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many" ([Matthew 27:52-53](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#52)). This enigmatic passage, appearing nowhere else in Scripture, demonstrates the cosmic significance of Jesus' death and its power over death itself.

**Peter Walking on Water**: While all Synoptics record Jesus walking on water, only Matthew includes Peter's attempt to walk on water, his beginning to sink when doubting, and Jesus' rebuke: "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" ([Matthew 14:28-31](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/14#28)). This unique episode emphasizes faith's necessity for participating in Jesus' supernatural work.

**The Temple Tax**: Matthew alone records the incident where Jesus instructs Peter to catch a fish containing a coin to pay the temple tax for both of them ([Matthew 17:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/17#24)). This unique miracle demonstrates Jesus' divine knowledge and His submission to legitimate authorities even while technically exempt.

These unique teachings establish Matthew's distinctive contribution to the fourfold Gospel witness, emphasizing Jesus' role as the Jewish Messiah who fulfills Torah, the authoritative teacher who establishes ethical standards for kingdom life, and the foundation of the church commissioned to disciple all nations.

## Textual Variants

The text of Matthew's Gospel, like all New Testament books, exists in thousands of manuscript copies containing variations arising from scribal transmission over centuries. Modern critical editions such as Nestle-Aland 28th edition (NA28) and United Bible Societies 5th edition (UBS5) present the same reconstructed Greek text with critical apparatuses documenting significant variants. While the UBS apparatus focuses on variants important for translation, the NA28 apparatus provides comprehensive documentation for scholarly study. Though approximately 500,000 non-spelling variants exist across all New Testament manuscripts, the vast majority represent minor spelling differences, word order variations, or copyist errors that do not affect doctrine or meaning. The significant variants in Matthew demonstrate both the general reliability of textual transmission and the careful work of textual criticism in reconstructing the original text.

**Manuscript Evidence for Matthew**: The Gospel of Matthew benefits from extensive early manuscript attestation. Papyri witnesses include P1 (early third century, containing [Matthew 1:1-9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1), [12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#12), [14-20](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#14), [23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#23)), P77/P103 (125-150 CE, among the oldest Matthew witnesses predating the great uncials), P64/67 (Magdalen Papyrus, c. 200 CE, containing portions of Matthew 3, 5, and 26), along with P19, P21, P25, P35, P37, P44, P45, P53, P62, P70, P71, and P86. Major uncial manuscripts include Codex Sinaiticus (א, fourth century, the earliest complete New Testament), Codex Vaticanus (B, fourth century), Codex Alexandrinus (A, fifth century), Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C, fifth century), and Codex Bezae (D, fifth century). These witnesses, spanning from the second to fifth centuries, provide the textual foundation for critical editions. Additionally, hundreds of minuscule manuscripts, lectionaries, Old Latin and Vulgate versions, Syriac versions (including Peshitta and Sinaitic Syriac), Coptic versions, and patristic quotations contribute to establishing Matthew's text.

**The Lord's Prayer Doxology** ([Matthew 6:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/6#13)): The most widely known textual variant in Matthew concerns the doxological conclusion to the Lord's Prayer: "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen" (ὅτι σοῦ ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ἀμήν). This conclusion is absent from the oldest and best manuscripts including Sinaiticus (original hand), Vaticanus, Ephraemi Rescriptus, along with the majority of Old Latin witnesses, the Vulgate, Coptic versions, and early patristic witnesses. The doxology appears in the Didache (c. 70-130 CE) in a slightly shorter form (lacking "the kingdom"), suggesting early liturgical usage independent of Matthew's Gospel. Later Byzantine manuscripts include the full doxology, which entered the Textus Receptus and thus the King James Version. Most scholars conclude the doxology represents a liturgical addition "to adapt the Prayer for liturgical use in the early church" (Bruce Metzger) rather than original Matthean text. Modern critical editions (NA28, UBS5) omit the doxology from the main text, though some editions include it in brackets. The UBS gives this variant a "C" rating (considerable doubt). Conservative scholarship generally accepts its secondary status while recognizing its ancient liturgical usage and theological appropriateness.

**The Virgin Birth in the Genealogy** ([Matthew 1:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#16)): Matthew's genealogy concludes with unusual phrasing that breaks the pattern maintained throughout: whereas previous verses state "A begot B," verse 16 reads "Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus." The Greek relative pronoun (ἧς, "of whom") is unambiguously feminine singular, pointing exclusively to Mary as Jesus' biological parent and implying the virgin birth. However, the Sinaitic Syriac manuscript (fifth century palimpsest) contains the variant: "Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, begot Jesus who is called the Christ." This reading appears self-contradictory (calling Mary "virgin" while stating Joseph "begot" Jesus) and is found only in this single Syriac witness. Raymond Brown and other scholars note this variant arose not to deny the virgin birth but likely reflects later debates over Mary's perpetual virginity. The overwhelming manuscript support for the standard reading, combined with its clear alignment with Matthew's virgin birth narrative ([Matthew 1:18-25](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#18)), establishes the original text as supporting the doctrine. This variant demonstrates that even early centuries witnessed attempts to harmonize or clarify perceived difficulties, though such attempts found minimal acceptance in manuscript tradition.

**The Spear Thrust** ([Matthew 27:49](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#49)): After recording the giving of sour wine to Jesus on the cross, some manuscripts add: "And another took a spear and pierced his side, and there came out water and blood" (ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἔνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευρὰν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὕδωρ καὶ αἷμα). This reading appears in significant early witnesses including Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Codices C, L, and U, approximately 35 minuscule manuscripts, some Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts (including the Book of Kells), Palestinian Aramaic, Ethiopic, and Middle Egyptian versions. The passage closely parallels [John 19:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/19#34), sharing vocabulary ("spear," "pierce," "side," "water and blood"). Despite this impressive early manuscript support, most scholars regard the reading as secondary for several reasons: (1) it creates a chronological problem, suggesting Jesus was pierced before death rather than after as John explicitly states; (2) the verbal similarity to John suggests assimilation from John's Gospel; (3) Matthew elsewhere shows no knowledge of this detail; (4) the majority of manuscripts lack the addition. This variant illustrates how early scribes sometimes harmonized Gospel accounts, incorporating details from one Gospel into parallel passages in another. Modern critical editions omit this addition from Matthew's text.

**The Weather Signs** ([Matthew 16:2b-3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/16#2)): When Pharisees and Sadducees request a sign, some manuscripts include Jesus' response: "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times." This passage is absent from the most ancient uncials Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, Codex X, manuscripts known to Origen and Jerome, and some Peshitta and Coptic versions. The passage appears in Codices C, D, L, and W, and the majority of later Byzantine manuscripts. Scholars have debated this variant since the nineteenth century. Those favoring omission note the absence from earliest witnesses and suggest the passage represents insertion from a source similar to [Luke 12:54-56](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/12#54) or from Luke itself. Frederick Scrivener and M.-J. Lagrange, however, argued the passage was omitted by copyists in climates (particularly Egypt, where Vaticanus and Sinaiticus originated) where red morning sky does not predict rain, making Jesus' illustration contextually inappropriate. The UBS gives inclusion a "C" rating (considerable doubt) and modern critical editions typically include the passage in brackets, indicating uncertainty. This variant demonstrates how geographical and cultural factors may have influenced textual transmission.

**Minor Name Variations in the Genealogy**: The genealogy in [Matthew 1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1) contains several minor textual variants in names. [Matthew 1:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#3) shows variation between "Ζαρε" (P1 and Vaticanus) and "Ζαρα" (later manuscripts), both referring to Zerah. [Matthew 1:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#10) shows early witnesses attesting "Ἀμώς" (Amos) rather than the historically correct "Ἀμών" (Amon), suggesting confusion between similar Hebrew names during Greek transmission. These minor variants in proper nouns illustrate common transcriptional variations that do not affect meaning or doctrine but reflect the challenges of transliterating Hebrew names into Greek.

**Barabbas's Full Name** ([Matthew 27:16-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#16)): Some manuscripts identify the prisoner as "Jesus Barabbas" rather than simply "Barabbas," making Pilate's question more pointed: "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?" Several early witnesses support the longer reading, though it was dropped from most manuscripts, possibly because copyists found it theologically objectionable to apply Jesus' name to the criminal. If original, the detail intensifies the irony: Israel chooses Jesus-who-is-a-criminal over Jesus-who-is-Messiah.

**Textual Reliability and Conservative Response**: Conservative evangelical scholars affirm that despite textual variants, Matthew's text remains fundamentally reliable. The variants discussed above—along with hundreds of others—do not call into question any major doctrine of Scripture. No variant affects the deity of Christ, the virgin birth (properly understood), the atoning death, the resurrection, or any essential Christian teaching. The existence of variants demonstrates the need for careful textual criticism but simultaneously validates the general accuracy of transmission: where variants exist, comparison of manuscripts usually makes clear which reading is original. The fact that scholars can identify secondary readings with reasonable confidence shows that the original text can be substantially recovered. The doctrines questioned by liberal scholarship (virgin birth, resurrection, etc.) rest on clear, multiply-attested texts without significant variant readings affecting their meaning. Furthermore, the early and widespread manuscript evidence for Matthew—including second-century papyri—demonstrates that the Gospel circulated widely in its original form within living memory of its composition. The church's consistent acceptance of Matthew's text, coupled with extensive manuscript evidence, provides confidence that modern critical editions present a text extremely close to what the apostolic author originally wrote.

## Textual Errors

Critics have alleged that Matthew's Gospel contains factual, historical, and prophetic errors that undermine its claim to divine inspiration. These alleged errors range from misattributed prophecies and botanical inaccuracies to historical contradictions and unfulfilled citations. Conservative evangelical scholarship responds that careful examination of context, ancient literary conventions, cultural background, and linguistic analysis resolves these difficulties, demonstrating that alleged "errors" reflect modern misunderstanding rather than ancient mistakes. The following addresses the most commonly cited examples.

**The Attribution to Jeremiah** ([Matthew 27:9-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#9)): Matthew states that Judas' betrayal for thirty pieces of silver fulfilled "what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet," yet the most obvious source is [Zechariah 11:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/11#12), which mentions thirty pieces of silver and a potter. Critics claim this represents a clear factual error—Matthew misattributed a Zechariah prophecy to Jeremiah. Conservative scholars offer several explanations. First, Matthew employs a common rabbinical technique of composite quotation, blending multiple prophetic texts: [Jeremiah 19:1-11](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/19#1) (potter and valley), [Jeremiah 32:6-9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/32#6) (purchasing a field), and [Zechariah 11:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/11#12) (thirty pieces of silver). In rabbinical practice, when multiple prophets are cited, the citation is attributed to the greater prophet—in this case, Jeremiah, who appears first in the canonical order of prophets and whose imagery of the potter and field purchase dominates Matthew's account. Second, only Jeremiah mentions the "field" of the potter ([Jeremiah 19:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/19#2); [32:6-9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/32#6)), the principal element in Matthew's quotation. Third, ancient Jewish tradition sometimes referred to the entire prophetic collection by its opening book (Jeremiah in the Jewish ordering), similar to modern references to "according to the Psalms" when citing any book in the Writings. Fourth, some scholars suggest Matthew had access to now-lost portions of Jeremiah or alternate textual traditions. While Jerome and Augustine acknowledged difficulty with this passage, conservative scholarship maintains that Matthew's attribution reflects intentional composite citation rather than error, demonstrating the Gospel's sophisticated use of Old Testament theology.

**The Nazarene Prophecy** ([Matthew 2:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#23)): Matthew concludes his infancy narrative stating Jesus' residence in Nazareth fulfilled "what was spoken by the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene." No such quotation exists in the Old Testament, leading skeptics to claim Matthew fabricated a prophecy or erred in his citation. Several explanations resolve this difficulty. First, Matthew uses the plural "prophets" rather than his usual singular "prophet," suggesting he references a general prophetic theme rather than a specific text. Second, "Nazarene" (Ναζωραῖος) likely connects to the Hebrew *netser* (נֵצֶר, "branch" or "shoot"), a messianic title appearing in [Isaiah 11:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/11#1) ("a shoot from the stump of Jesse"), [Jeremiah 23:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/23#5), [33:15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/jeremiah/33#15), [Zechariah 3:8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/3#8), and [6:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/6#12). Matthew employs wordplay connecting Jesus' geographical origin (Nazareth) with His messianic identity (the Branch). Third, many prophecies indicate the Messiah would be despised ([Psalm 22:6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/psalm/22#6); [Isaiah 49:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/49#7); [53:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/isaiah/53#3)); Nazareth was proverbially despised ([John 1:46](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/1#46): "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"), thus Jesus' Nazarene identity fulfilled prophecies of the Messiah's humble, rejected status. Fourth, Matthew may reference oral prophetic traditions preserved in first-century Judaism but not included in written Scripture. Rather than error, Matthew demonstrates sophisticated theological reflection connecting geography, etymology, and messianic prophecy.

**The Zechariah Identification** ([Matthew 23:35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/23#35)): Jesus declares the religious leaders guilty "from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar." This appears erroneous: [2 Chronicles 24:20-22](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/2_chronicles/24#20) records the murder of "Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest" in the temple court, not "Zechariah son of Barachiah." The prophet Zechariah was indeed "the son of Berechiah" ([Zechariah 1:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/1#1)), but no biblical record documents his martyrdom in the temple. Critics claim Matthew (or Jesus) confused two different Zechariahs. Conservative responses include: (1) "Son of" (בֶּן, *ben*) in Hebrew can mean "descendant of" across multiple generations; the martyred Zechariah may have been the grandson or descendant of Barachiah while being the immediate son of Jehoiada. (2) Some early manuscripts (Syriac Sinaiticus, Armenian) omit "the son of Barachiah," suggesting possible scribal addition to the original text; if so, Jesus simply said "Zechariah" with later copyists adding the patronymic, inadvertently creating the difficulty. (3) The prophet Zechariah may indeed have been martyred in the temple, with the event recorded in sources now lost to us; Josephus records another Zechariah son of Baruch murdered in the temple during the Jewish War (*Wars* 4.5.4), demonstrating that such events occurred and were remembered. (4) Jewish tradition (Targum Lamentations, Lives of the Prophets) does associate the prophet Zechariah with martyrdom, suggesting knowledge Matthew may have possessed. (5) Jesus' point spans from Abel (first martyr in Genesis) to Zechariah (last martyr in 2 Chronicles, the final book in Hebrew canon ordering), covering the entire span of Scripture; the identification specifics matter less than the comprehensive scope. While uncertainty remains, these explanations demonstrate the alleged error admits plausible resolution without undermining biblical authority.

**Genealogical Differences from Luke**: Matthew's genealogy ([Matthew 1:1-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#1)) differs significantly from Luke's ([Luke 3:23-38](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/3#23)). Both agree from Abraham to David but diverge afterward: Matthew traces descent through Solomon, Luke through Nathan (both David's sons). Matthew names Jacob as Joseph's father ([Matthew 1:16](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/1#16)), Luke names Heli ([Luke 3:23](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/3#23)). Matthew lists 28 generations from David to Jesus, Luke lists 41. Critics claim these genealogies contradict, proving at least one erroneous. Traditional conservative explanation maintains Matthew provides Jesus' legal, royal lineage through Joseph (establishing legal claim to David's throne), while Luke provides Jesus' biological lineage through Mary (explaining His physical Davidic descent). If "Joseph son of Heli" follows ancient levirate marriage custom or represents Joseph as Heli's son-in-law (Mary's father being Heli), the genealogies trace different lines converging in Jesus. Matthew emphasizes Jesus' legal right to kingship (through Solomon's royal line), Luke emphasizes Jesus' physical descent from David (through Nathan). Both serve theological purposes: Matthew addresses Jewish concerns about messianic credentials, Luke demonstrates Jesus' true humanity and universal significance (tracing back to Adam). Rather than errors, the genealogies reflect different purposes, audiences, and lines of descent, demonstrating complementary rather than contradictory testimony.

**The Mustard Seed Statement** ([Matthew 13:31-32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#31)): Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven as "a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds." Critics note the mustard seed is not botanically the smallest seed—orchid seeds, petunia seeds, and others are smaller. This allegedly demonstrates factual error. Conservative responses recognize Jesus spoke within cultural-agricultural context, not as a modern botanist. First, Jesus addressed Palestinian farmers familiar with commonly cultivated seeds (wheat, barley, lentils, beans); among agricultural seeds in first-century Palestine, mustard was proverbially the smallest. Second, Jesus employed proverbial language; "smallest seed" was a common Jewish idiom (found in Talmudic literature) expressing minuteness, similar to modern "needle in a haystack" (not claiming needles exist only in haystacks). Third, Jesus taught theology, not botany; His point concerned the kingdom's dramatic growth from tiny beginnings, not scientific seed taxonomy. Fourth, the parable also states the mustard plant becomes "larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree" ([Matthew 13:32](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/13#32))—obviously hyperbolic since mustard plants don't exceed olive trees or other garden plants. Recognizing one element as hyperbolic illustration requires recognizing the "smallest" claim similarly. Jesus used phenomenological language (describing appearances and common perceptions) rather than technical scientific description, a distinction hermeneutically essential for understanding ancient texts. To charge Jesus with error for using proverbial agricultural language reflects anachronistic imposition of modern scientific standards onto ancient rhetorical communication.

**The Birth Chronology**: Matthew places Jesus' birth during Herod the Great's reign ([Matthew 2:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/2#1)), who died in 4 BCE. Luke associates Jesus' birth with Quirinius' census ([Luke 2:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/2#2)), occurring in 6 CE. Critics claim this ten-year discrepancy proves at least one Gospel erroneous. Most scholars acknowledge Luke presents greater chronological difficulty (census requiring return to ancestral towns, census allegedly applying to Galilee when Quirinius governed only Judea, etc.). Conservative responses include: (1) Archaeological evidence (Lapis Tiburtinus inscription, though incomplete) suggests Quirinius may have governed Syria twice—once around 4-1 BCE (during Herod's reign) and again in 6 CE, with Luke referring to the earlier census. (2) The Greek *prōtē* ([Luke 2:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/2#2)) could mean "before" rather than "first," rendering "this census took place before Quirinius was governor of Syria," resolving the difficulty entirely. (3) Census enrollments often took years to complete; a census initiated during Herod's reign may have extended into Quirinius' governorship. (4) Matthew's account contains firmer chronological anchors (Herod's massacre, death, Archelaus' succession), while Luke's census reference may be approximate or refer to regional enrollment preceding the formal 6 CE census. While uncertainty persists, conservative scholarship maintains the difficulty resides more in Luke than Matthew, and solutions remain historically plausible pending additional archaeological evidence. The objection does not establish demonstrable error in Matthew's dating.

**Conservative Affirmation of Matthean Accuracy**: Conservative evangelical scholarship maintains that alleged errors in Matthew reflect interpretive misunderstanding rather than factual mistakes. Ancient texts require interpretation according to ancient conventions, including composite quotation, proverbial language, phenomenological description, hyperbole, genealogical selectivity, and thematic arrangement over strict chronology. Matthew wrote as an ancient historian-theologian, not a modern scientific reporter; judging his work by 21st-century standards commits the anachronistic fallacy. Where difficulties exist (Zechariah's parentage, prophetic citations), they admit plausible explanations consistent with inspiration and inerrancy. Furthermore, Matthew's demonstrated accuracy in verifiable details (geographical references, cultural practices, religious customs, political circumstances) warrants extending interpretive charity where difficulties arise. The early church, possessing far greater access to eyewitnesses and historical context than modern skeptics, universally accepted Matthew as accurate apostolic testimony. No alleged error affects any essential Christian doctrine or undermines the Gospel's central message: Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah who fulfilled Scripture, died for sins, and rose from the dead. Difficulties exist in transmitting and interpreting any ancient text; their existence in Matthew no more proves error than similar difficulties in Josephus, Tacitus, or Herodotus prove those historians unreliable. Conservative scholarship continues affirming Matthew's historical reliability while acknowledging that full resolution of every difficulty awaits further historical and archaeological evidence.

## Contradictions

Critics frequently allege that Matthew's Gospel contains internal contradictions and irreconcilable discrepancies when compared with the other three Gospels. These alleged contradictions span resurrection accounts, miracle narratives, chronological sequences, and the details of Jesus' death and burial. Skeptics argue these variations demonstrate that the Gospels cannot all be true, undermining claims of inspiration and inerrancy. Conservative scholarship responds that apparent contradictions dissolve when ancient biographical conventions, complementary rather than contradictory reporting, eyewitness perspective differences, literary compression, and theological selectivity are properly understood. The Gospels function as ancient Greco-Roman biographies (*bios* literature), which prioritized theological interpretation and thematic arrangement over strict chronological precision, allowed paraphrase and summary, and selected material according to authorial purpose. Alleged contradictions typically represent different perspectives on the same events rather than mutually exclusive claims, analogous to how multiple witnesses describe the same accident from different vantage points with varying details yet consistent core facts.

**The Resurrection Accounts** ([Matthew 28:1-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#1)): The most frequently cited contradictions concern resurrection morning details. Critics note: Matthew mentions "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary" ([Matthew 28:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#1)), Mark adds Salome ([Mark 16:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/16#1)), Luke names "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women" ([Luke 24:10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/24#10)), while John focuses solely on Mary Magdalene ([John 20:1](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/20#1)). Regarding angels, Matthew records one angel ([Matthew 28:2-5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/28#2)), Mark one young man ([Mark 16:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/16#5)), Luke two men ([Luke 24:4](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/24#4)), and John two angels ([John 20:12](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/20#12)). Conservative harmonization recognizes that none of these accounts claims exclusivity. Matthew and Mark focus on the spokesperson angel who delivered the primary message, while Luke and John mention both angels present. Regarding women, Matthew and Mark provide abbreviated lists; Luke offers more complete enumeration; John spotlights Mary Magdalene's experience without denying others' presence. Ancient biographical writing commonly selected details supporting authorial purpose rather than exhaustively cataloging every participant. Furthermore, multiple women likely made multiple trips to the tomb that morning, with different Gospel writers focusing on different visits or different groups. The core agreement remains unshaken: the tomb was empty, angels announced Jesus' resurrection, women encountered the risen Lord, disciples verified the empty tomb. Differences in peripheral details actually strengthen rather than undermine historical reliability—fabricated accounts typically demonstrate suspicious uniformity, while authentic independent testimony naturally varies in perspective and detail selection while agreeing on essentials.

**Judas' Death** ([Matthew 27:3-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#3) cf. [Acts 1:18-19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/1#18)): Matthew states Judas "hanged himself" ([Matthew 27:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#5)), while Acts records he "falling headlong...burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out" ([Acts 1:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/1#18)). Additionally, Matthew says the chief priests bought the field with returned blood money ([Matthew 27:6-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/27#6)), Acts states Judas himself purchased the field ([Acts 1:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/acts/1#18)). Conservative harmonization proposes sequential complementary accounts: Judas hanged himself (Matthew's focus on method of suicide), the rope or branch broke or the body decomposed, causing the corpse to fall and burst upon impact (Luke's focus in Acts on grotesque final result). Ancient corpses exposed to heat experience rapid decomposition and gas buildup, particularly in abdominal regions; a fall from hanging, even from moderate height, could easily cause a decomposed body to rupture as Acts describes. Regarding field purchase, the priests technically bought the field, but since they used Judas' returned money and purchased it in his name (since they could not put blood money in the temple treasury), both "the priests bought" and "Judas bought" remain true from different perspectives. This resembles modern legal language where a corporation "purchases" property though individual officers execute transactions. The field's name "Field of Blood" fits both accounts: Matthew emphasizes the blood money used to purchase it, Acts the blood spilled when Judas' body burst. Rather than contradiction, the accounts provide complementary perspectives on the same tragic end.

**The Centurion's Servant** ([Matthew 8:5-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#5) cf. [Luke 7:1-10](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/7#1)): Matthew states the centurion "came to him" ([Matthew 8:5](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/8#5)) directly requesting healing, while Luke records the centurion "sent to him elders of the Jews" ([Luke 7:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/7#3)) and later "sent friends" ([Luke 7:6](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/7#6)). Critics claim this demonstrates irreconcilable contradiction—either the centurion came personally or sent intermediaries, not both. Conservative response invokes the ancient law of agency: emissaries acting on another's authority were legally and socially regarded as equivalent to the principal himself acting. Numerous biblical examples demonstrate this principle: [2 Samuel 3:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/2_samuel/3#18), [14:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/2_samuel/14#19), [2 Kings 14:27](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/2_kings/14#27), [Esther 8:8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/esther/8#8), [Ezra 1:7-8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/ezra/1#7). When authorized representatives speak, ancient literature attributes speech directly to the one who authorized them. Matthew employs narrative compression (telescoping), a common ancient literary technique omitting intermediary details to focus on principals; Luke, who explicitly claims thorough investigation ([Luke 1:3](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/1#3)), includes fuller circumstantial detail. Both accounts remain historically accurate: the centurion did approach Jesus (through authorized representatives), and intermediaries were physically present. Neither Matthew nor Luke claims exclusivity contradicting the other; they simply emphasize different aspects according to their distinct purposes and audiences.

**Peter's Denial Prediction** ([Matthew 26:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#34) cf. [Mark 14:30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/14#30)): Matthew, Luke, and John record Jesus predicting "before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times" ([Matthew 26:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/26#34); [Luke 22:34](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/22#34); [John 13:38](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/13#38)). Mark records "before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times" ([Mark 14:30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/14#30)). Critics see contradiction: did Jesus predict one crow or two? Conservative harmonization notes Mark provides greater precision—Jesus predicted three denials before the rooster's second crow. If Peter denied Jesus three times before the rooster crowed twice (especially if the two crows occurred in quick succession), it remains equally true that Peter denied Him before the rooster crowed (without specifying which crow). Matthew, Luke, and John streamline to the essential point without denying additional details. Mark, traditionally associated with Peter's preaching ([1 Peter 5:13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/1_peter/5#13)), likely preserves Peter's own vivid memory of that night, including his awareness of both crowings. The more detailed account includes rather than contradicts the less detailed. This resembles someone saying "I called you three times before you answered" versus another saying "I called you three times before you answered on the fourth ring"—the second statement provides additional precision without contradicting the first.

**The Triumphal Entry** ([Matthew 21:1-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#1) cf. [Mark 11:1-7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#1)): Matthew mentions both "a donkey, and a colt" ([Matthew 21:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#2)), stating the disciples "brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them" ([Matthew 21:7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#7)). Mark, Luke, and John mention only the colt ([Mark 11:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#2), [7](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#7); [Luke 19:30](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/19#30), [35](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/luke/19#35); [John 12:14-15](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/12#14)). Skeptics charge Matthew invented a second animal through misunderstanding [Zechariah 9:9](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/zechariah/9#9)'s Hebrew parallelism ("mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey"), failing to recognize this describes one animal from two perspectives. Conservative response maintains both animals were present: Matthew, emphasizing fulfillment of Zechariah's prophecy for his Jewish audience, mentions both animals; Mark, Luke, and John focus on the colt Jesus actually rode. Matthew does not state Jesus rode both animals simultaneously—"sat on them" likely refers to the cloaks placed on both animals rather than to both animals themselves. The mother donkey accompanied her unbroken colt (which "no one has ever yet sat," [Mark 11:2](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#2)) to calm it, a practical consideration when riding an untrained young animal through crowds. Matthew's dual mention reflects neither error nor misunderstanding but accurate reporting of both animals' presence combined with emphasis on prophetic fulfillment. The other Evangelists, not addressing the same Jewish apologetic concerns, mention only the animal Jesus rode without denying another's presence.

**Chronological Variations**: Critics note apparent chronological contradictions: Matthew places the temple cleansing during Passion Week ([Matthew 21:12-13](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#12)), while John places it at the beginning of Jesus' ministry ([John 2:13-17](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/john/2#13)); Matthew records the fig tree withering "at once" ([Matthew 21:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/matthew/21#19)), Mark says it withered overnight with disciples noticing the next morning ([Mark 11:12-14](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#12), [20-21](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/books/mark/11#20)). Conservative responses note: (1) Jesus may have cleansed the temple twice—once at ministry's beginning (John) and again during Passion Week (Synoptics), demonstrating consistent righteous zeal for His Father's house. (2) Ancient biographies regularly arranged material thematically rather than strictly chronologically; none of the Gospels claims rigid chronological sequencing for every event. (3) Regarding the fig tree, Matthew compresses the event into single narrative for theological emphasis (immediate judgment on Israel's fruitlessness), while Mark provides fuller chronological detail (curse, overnight withering, morning discovery). Both remain accurate: the tree did wither "at once" (immediately upon Jesus' curse, though not observed until next morning), and disciples did observe it the following morning. Matthew's compression serves theological purpose without historical fabrication, analogous to modern biographical writing that may discuss someone's "college years" topically rather than semester-by-semester chronologically.

**Conservative Response to Contradiction Allegations**: Evangelical scholarship maintains that alleged Gospel contradictions reflect misunderstanding of ancient literary genres, biographical conventions, and the nature of harmonious testimony rather than contradictory testimony. True contradiction requires mutually exclusive claims—"A" and "not-A" about the same thing in the same way at the same time. Gospel variations rarely if ever meet this standard. Differences in perspective, selectivity, detail, emphasis, and arrangement do not constitute logical contradiction. Multiple eyewitnesses to any event naturally report with variation in peripheral details while agreeing on central facts; this actually enhances rather than diminishes historical reliability. Furthermore, Gospel writers exercised authorial prerogatives common in ancient biography: paraphrase of discourse, arrangement by theme rather than strict chronology, selection of material suited to purpose and audience, compression and expansion according to theological emphasis. Modern historical writing operates differently; judging ancient texts by modern standards commits the anachronistic fallacy. The early church, far closer temporally and culturally to events and possessing access to eyewitnesses who could correct errors, accepted all four Gospels as accurate testimony. If contradictions were as obvious and irreconcilable as skeptics claim, early readers with far greater access to verifying information would have rejected these accounts. Instead, the church recognized complementary perspectives providing fuller understanding than any single account could offer. Difficulties remain in some passages, but honest investigation demonstrates that alleged contradictions admit plausible harmonization consistent with inerrancy. The presence of variations actually argues for authenticity—collusive fabrication typically produces artificial uniformity, while genuine independent testimony varies in peripheral details while maintaining core agreement. Conservative scholarship continues affirming that Matthew's Gospel, properly understood within its ancient literary context alongside the other Gospel witnesses, provides historically reliable, divinely inspired testimony to Jesus Christ without genuine contradiction.
