# Daniel

## Authorship

The authorship and dating of the Book of Daniel are subjects of intense debate. The traditional view, upheld by Jewish and Christian traditions for millennia, posits that [the prophet Daniel himself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_(biblical_figure)) wrote the book during the [Babylonian exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) (around 530 BCE). Proponents cite linguistic analysis of its Aramaic and Hebrew, and the presence of [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) manuscripts (c. 200-160 BCE) as too early for a later composition. This view emphasizes Daniel as genuine predictive prophecy, authenticated by Jesus (Matthew 24:15).

However, the overwhelming majority of modern biblical scholars date Daniel to the mid-2nd century BCE (c. 167-164 BCE), during the [Maccabean period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabees) and persecution under [Antiochus IV Epiphanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes). This view, first articulated by [Porphyry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyry_(philosopher)), argues that Daniel 11's extreme historical accuracy up to Antiochus's reign, followed by inaccuracies, suggests *vaticinium ex eventu* (prophecy after the event). Critical scholars also point to developed apocalyptic genre, emphasis on resurrection, and placement in the Ketuvim. The debate reflects differing methodological approaches to predictive prophecy.

## Historical Environment

The historical setting of Daniel is debated. The traditional view places its writing in the 6th century BCE, during the [Babylonian exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity), with Daniel serving in the courts of Babylon and Persia. This context would make the book's visions genuine predictive prophecy. However, the overwhelming scholarly consensus dates the book to the [Maccabean crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt) (c. 167-164 BCE), a period of intense persecution under the Seleucid king [Antiochus IV Epiphanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes). In this view, the book was written to encourage persecuted Jews by recounting tales of faithfulness in a foreign court and offering apocalyptic visions assuring God's ultimate sovereignty and vindication. Regardless of its date, the book addresses Jews living in the [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora), grappling with maintaining their identity under foreign rule.

## Purpose

The Book of Daniel serves multiple interconnected purposes, all oriented toward strengthening the faith and identity of Jews living under foreign domination and facing pressure to compromise their religious convictions.

### Primary Purpose: Encouragement During Persecution

The most widely recognized purpose of Daniel is to provide comfort, strength, and encouragement to Jews suffering persecution. According to the scholarly consensus that dates the book to the [Maccabean period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt), Daniel was specifically composed during the bitter persecution carried on by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (167-164 BCE) to strengthen and comfort the Jewish people in their ordeal. The dominant tone throughout the book is one of encouragement rather than chastisement, offering hope to readers facing dark times and severe trials.

The three major stories of faithfulness despite persecution—Daniel's adherence to dietary laws despite pressure (chapter 1), the three youths' refusal to worship the golden image and their deliverance from the fiery furnace (chapter 3), and Daniel's rescue from the lions' den (chapter 6)—serve as powerful examples meant to inspire contemporary readers facing similar pressures. Just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his companions from their enemies, so too God would save the Israelites in their present oppression. The message is clear: it is possible to live a life of faith and victory with God's help, even in the most adverse circumstances.

### Theological Objective: Affirming God's Sovereignty Over History

At its theological core, Daniel addresses the fundamental question that arises when God's people suffer under pagan empires: Is God truly sovereign? The book's resounding answer is that [God reigns supreme](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/global-message-of-daniel/) in heaven and earth, controlling the rise and fall of kingdoms according to His divine purpose. This theme of divine sovereignty permeates both the court tales (chapters 1-6) and the apocalyptic visions (chapters 7-12).

The famous vision in Daniel 2 of Nebuchadnezzar's dream—a great statue composed of different materials representing successive empires (traditionally interpreted as Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, and Roman)—culminates in a stone "cut out by no human hand" that destroys the statue and becomes a great mountain filling the earth (Daniel 2:31-45). This symbolizes that all human kingdoms, regardless of their power, are temporary and subject to God's will, while God's kingdom will ultimately triumph and last forever. The narrative portrays God as the ultimate ruler "who establishes and removes kings according to His divine purpose" (Daniel 2:21), reassuring readers that regardless of political turmoil or challenges, God remains in control, guiding history toward His intended outcomes.

The progression through the apocalyptic visions intensifies this message. While earlier visions show God controlling the succession of empires, the later visions (especially chapters 10-12) escalate to cosmic proportions, depicting the battle against evil as ultimately supernatural. The assurance is given that evil will finally be defeated, and "in the end, there will be no more imperial coming and going, only the reign of God, which will create new life beyond the turmoil of history."

### Addressing the Crisis of Jewish Identity Under Foreign Rule

Daniel tackles the existential question facing diaspora Jews: How does one survive under a foreign empire while remaining a faithful Jew amidst all the threats to Jewish identity? The book presents a nuanced model of [accommodation and resistance](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/esther-and-daniel-biblical-advice-for-diaspora-communities/). Daniel and his companions do accommodate themselves to some elements of Babylonian culture—they receive Babylonian names, learn Babylonian literature and language, and serve in the imperial court. However, they draw clear boundaries, refusing the king's food to maintain dietary laws (Daniel 1:8-16), refusing to worship idols (Daniel 3:16-18), and maintaining their pattern of prayer even when illegal (Daniel 6:10).

This narrative raises and answers the central question: When is accommodation acceptable, and when must one resist even at the cost of one's life? The heroes demonstrate that faithfulness to God's law is non-negotiable, even when it puts them in grave danger. Yet they also show that Jews can serve honorably in foreign governments and contribute to society while maintaining their distinctive identity. This provided crucial guidance for Jews navigating life in diaspora settings under Persian, Hellenistic, and later Roman rule.

### Providing a Framework for Understanding Suffering

The apocalyptic visions in Daniel 7-12 offer a sophisticated theological framework for making sense of the persecution and suffering experienced by God's people. Rather than viewing their tribulation as meaningless or as evidence of God's absence, the visions reframe it as part of God's sovereign plan for history. The persecutions have been foreordained and are limited in duration; they will end according to God's predetermined timeline (note the specific time periods mentioned: "time, times, and half a time" in Daniel 7:25; 12:7; the 1,290 and 1,335 days in Daniel 12:11-12).

This apocalyptic perspective transforms suffering from a theological crisis into evidence that God's plan is unfolding as predicted. Those who endure faithfully are assured not just of eventual vindication, but of participation in God's eternal kingdom through resurrection (Daniel 12:2-3). The wise who lead many to righteousness will "shine like the brightness of the heavens" and "like the stars for ever and ever."

### Demonstrating the Superiority of Israel's God

Throughout the court tales, Daniel demonstrates that the wisdom and power available through Israel's God far surpasses anything the pagan nations possess. Daniel and his companions prove physically healthier on a Jewish diet than those who eat the royal food (Daniel 1). Daniel can interpret dreams that baffle all the Babylonian wise men (Daniel 2, 4). God delivers from fire and lions what human power cannot prevent (Daniel 3, 6). Nebuchadnezzar himself is brought to acknowledge the Most High God's sovereignty (Daniel 4:34-37).

These narratives served multiple purposes: they vindicated Jewish faith against syncretistic pressures, demonstrated that loyalty to the God of Israel led to success rather than failure, and assured readers that their God was more powerful than any earthly king or empire. In contexts where Jews might be tempted to adopt the gods and practices of their conquerors for pragmatic reasons, Daniel insists that faithfulness to the covenant God is both the right choice and the wise one.

## Cross-References

The Book of Daniel exerted profound influence on the New Testament, particularly on Jesus's own teaching and the apocalyptic visions in Revelation. Daniel is one of the most frequently referenced Old Testament books in the New Testament, with its themes, imagery, and prophecies appearing throughout the Gospels, Epistles, and especially Revelation.

### Jesus's Direct Citations of Daniel

Jesus explicitly referenced Daniel by name in the [Olivet Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivet_Discourse), his prophetic teaching about the destruction of the Temple and future tribulation. In Matthew 24:15, Jesus warned: "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)..." Mark 13:14 contains a parallel account: "But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."

This reference to "the abomination of desolation" points back to multiple passages in Daniel (Daniel 9:27, 11:31, 12:11) that originally referred to Antiochus IV Epiphanes' desecration of the Temple in 167 BCE. Jesus's citation is particularly significant because it explicitly validates Daniel as a prophet and treats the book as authoritative Scripture. This reference has been interpreted variously as pointing to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, to future eschatological events, or to both in a pattern of multiple fulfillments.

### The Son of Man: Daniel 7:13 in the Gospels and Revelation

The most pervasive influence of Daniel on the New Testament comes through Jesus's self-identification as the [Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_man), a title derived directly from Daniel 7:13: "I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him" (Daniel 7:13). Jesus used this title for himself throughout his ministry, appearing over 80 times in the Gospels.

The connection becomes most explicit in Jesus's trial before the Sanhedrin. When the high priest asked if he was the Messiah, Jesus responded by directly quoting Daniel 7:13: "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matthew 26:64). Mark's parallel account records: "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven" (Mark 14:62). The high priest immediately understood this as a claim to divinity and charged Jesus with blasphemy, demonstrating that both Jesus and his interrogators recognized Daniel 7:13 as referring to a divine figure.

Other significant Gospel references to Daniel 7:13 include:

- Matthew 24:30: "Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
- Luke 21:27: "And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."
- Acts 1:11: Angels tell the apostles at Jesus's ascension, "This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven," echoing the cloud imagery from Daniel 7:13.

The book of Revelation prominently features Daniel 7:13 imagery. Revelation 1:7 declares: "Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him." Revelation 14:14 presents a vision directly parallel to Daniel 7: "Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand."

### Daniel's Massive Influence on Revelation

Of all New Testament books, Revelation draws most heavily from Daniel. Scholars estimate that Daniel provides the largest number of Old Testament references in Revelation in proportion to its length, with Daniel having the biggest impact on Revelation among all Old Testament books](https://www.agapebiblestudy.com/charts/Parallels between Visions of Revelation and Prophet Daniel.htm). Of Revelation's 404 verses, approximately 278 (68.8%) contain some allusion to the Old Testament, with Daniel contributing a disproportionate share.

Key parallels and allusions include:

- **The Four Beasts**: Daniel 7's vision of four beasts emerging from the sea directly influences Revelation 13's beast from the sea and Revelation 17's scarlet beast.
- **Ancient of Days**: Daniel 7:9's "Ancient of Days" with white hair like wool appears in Revelation 1:14's description of the glorified Christ.
- **The Little Horn**: Daniel 7:8, 24-25's little horn that speaks boastfully parallels Revelation 13:5-6's beast that speaks blasphemies.
- **Time Periods**: Daniel's "time, times, and half a time" (Daniel 7:25; 12:7) reappears in Revelation 12:14. Daniel's 1,290 and 1,335 days (Daniel 12:11-12) correspond to Revelation's 1,260 days and 42 months (Revelation 11:2-3; 12:6; 13:5).
- **Throne Visions**: Daniel 7:9-10's throne room scene with thousands ministering influences Revelation 4-5's elaborate throne room vision.
- **Sealed Scrolls**: Daniel 12:4, 9's command to seal up the prophecy until the end contrasts with Revelation 22:10's command not to seal up the prophecy because the time is near.
- **Michael the Archangel**: Daniel 10:13, 21 and 12:1's references to Michael as a great prince protecting Israel reappear in Revelation 12:7's war in heaven where Michael fights the dragon.
- **Books Opened**: Daniel 7:10's scene where "the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened" parallels Revelation 20:12's judgment scene where "the dead were judged by what was written in the books."

### Allusions in Hebrews

While Hebrews does not contain direct quotations from Daniel, it likely alludes to Daniel's experiences in Hebrews 11:33-34 during its survey of faithful heroes: "who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword." The references to stopping lions' mouths and quenching fire almost certainly point to Daniel 6 (Daniel in the lions' den) and Daniel 3 (Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace).

### References in the Epistles

While the Epistles quote Daniel less explicitly than the Gospels and Revelation, Pauline eschatology shows Daniel's influence. Second Thessalonians 1:7, 10 references the coming of the Lord "with his mighty angels in flaming fire" and when "he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints," echoing Daniel's apocalyptic imagery and the vindication of the saints in Daniel 7:18, 22, 27.

### Statistical Summary

While exact counts vary depending on whether one includes indirect allusions, Daniel's influence on the New Testament is substantial:

- Jesus explicitly names Daniel as a prophet (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14)
- The "Son of Man" title, used over 80 times in the Gospels, derives from Daniel 7:13
- Revelation contains hundreds of Old Testament allusions, with Daniel providing more proportionally than almost any other book
- Daniel's apocalyptic framework—succession of empires, persecution of saints, divine judgment, resurrection, eternal kingdom—shapes the entire eschatological outlook of the New Testament

The extensive use of Daniel in the New Testament demonstrates that the early Christian community viewed it as authoritative Scripture containing genuine prophecy about the Messiah and the end times.

## Canonical Status

The canonical status of Daniel involves several interrelated questions: why it appears in the Writings rather than the Prophets in the Hebrew Bible, what additional material was included in Greek versions, and how rapidly it achieved authoritative status. These questions intersect with the debates about authorship and dating discussed earlier.

### Placement in the Hebrew Bible: Ketuvim Not Nevi'im

In the [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Tanakh), Daniel appears in the Ketuvim (Writings), the third section of the canon, rather than in the Nevi'im (Prophets) where one might expect to find it. This placement is significant and has sparked considerable discussion. Jesus himself referred to "the prophet Daniel" (Matthew 24:15), and the early Christian church consistently treated Daniel as a prophetic book, yet traditional Jewish categorization places it among the Writings alongside books like Psalms, Proverbs, and Chronicles.

Several explanations have been proposed for this placement:

**Late Composition Theory**: The most common scholarly explanation is that Daniel was composed after the prophetic canon had already closed. Later rabbinic tradition asserts that prophecy ceased with the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, meaning that books composed thereafter were not included in the prophetic canon. Since critical scholars date Daniel to 168-164 BCE, it would have been written well after the Nevi'im collection was finalized, leaving the Ketuvim as its only possible canonical location. This explanation aligns with the view that Daniel has "the most recent final date of composition" of any book in the Ketuvim, with chapters 10-12 written sometime between 168 and 164 BCE.

**Level of Inspiration**: Traditional Jewish interpretation offers a theological explanation. The [Talmud does not consider Daniel to have been a prophet](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1735365/jewish/Why-Isnt-the-Book-of-Daniel-Part-of-the-Prophets.htm) in the technical sense. While acknowledging that Daniel had visions, rabbinic tradition views them as occurring at the level of *ruach ha-kodesh* (divine inspiration or "holy spirit") rather than full prophecy (*nevu'ah*). This distinction meant Daniel belonged among the Writings, books composed under divine inspiration, rather than among the Prophets, books containing direct prophetic oracles meant for public proclamation.

**Function of Prophecy**: Another traditional explanation focuses on the function and content of prophecy. The books classified as "prophets" were those whose authors were given prophecy to convey to the people at that moment for some immediate purpose—calling Israel to repentance, warning of judgment, or announcing deliverance. Daniel, by contrast, was an "armchair prophet" or court sage. While he had visions, he was never ordered to convey them publicly to Israel. His visions were primarily for his own understanding and for future generations, fitting the character of Writings rather than Prophets.

**Conservative Response**: Conservative scholars who date Daniel to the 6th century BCE argue that its placement in the Writings simply reflects its unique character and perhaps the circumstances of its late arrival in Judea (if composed in Babylonian exile), not necessarily late composition. They note that Chronicles, though dealing with much earlier historical periods, also appears in the Writings, demonstrating that canonical placement doesn't always reflect chronology of composition.

### The Deuterocanonical Additions

The question of Daniel's canon becomes more complex when considering the differences between Hebrew and Greek versions. The [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) (LXX), the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, contains three additional sections not found in the Hebrew/Aramaic text of Daniel:

1. **The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children**: An insertion into Daniel 3 (appearing as Daniel 3:24-90 in the Greek translation) that expands the fiery furnace episode. It includes a penitential prayer by Azariah (Abednego) and a hymn of praise sung by all three youths while in the furnace.

2. **Susanna**: A story about Daniel's early life when he was a young man. It recounts how Daniel cross-examined two elders who falsely accused a righteous woman named Susanna of adultery. This appears before Daniel 1:1 in early Greek manuscripts but is designated as chapter 13 in the Vulgate.

3. **Bel and the Dragon**: Two stories demonstrating the foolishness of idol worship. In the first, Daniel proves that the idol Bel does not actually consume the food offerings left for it. In the second, Daniel destroys a living dragon worshipped as a god and survives being thrown into a lions' den. This appears after Daniel 12:13 in Greek manuscripts and is designated as chapter 14 in the Vulgate.

These [Additions to Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additions_to_Daniel) are found only in the Greek textual tradition, with no known Hebrew or Aramaic originals (though some scholars speculate they may have originally been composed in Semitic languages and later lost). Their canonical status differs among Christian traditions:

- **Eastern Orthodox Churches**: Accept the additions as fully canonical Scripture, equal in authority to the rest of Daniel.
- **Roman Catholic Church**: Recognizes them as deuterocanonical ("second canon"), meaning they are inspired Scripture but were not part of the original Hebrew Bible. They are included in Catholic Bibles.
- **Protestant Churches**: Reject them as apocryphal—historically interesting and sometimes published in separate Apocrypha sections, but not inspired Scripture and lacking divine authority. They are excluded from most Protestant Bibles.

The rationale for these different approaches centers on questions about which text tradition (Hebrew/Aramaic Masoretic Text vs. Greek Septuagint) should be authoritative and what criteria determine canonicity.

### Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls

The [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), discovered at Qumran beginning in 1947, provide important evidence for Daniel's early canonical status. Multiple copies of Daniel were found among the scrolls, with eight manuscripts identified (4QDana through 4QDanh). Significantly, two of these manuscripts (4QDanc and 4QDane) have been radiocarbon dated to the late 2nd century BCE, making them among the oldest biblical manuscripts ever discovered.

The presence of multiple Daniel manuscripts at Qumran suggests the book was highly valued by the community. More importantly, the [Florilegium (4Q174)](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-formation-of-the-jewish-canon/), a collection of biblical interpretations, quotes Daniel 12:10 with the formula "as it is written in the book of Daniel the Prophet"—a formula typically used only when citing canonical Scripture. This demonstrates that by approximately 150 BCE (when the Qumran community was likely formed), Daniel was already regarded as prophetic Scripture, not merely as historical or wisdom literature.

This evidence creates a significant challenge for the late-dating hypothesis. If Daniel was composed around 165 BCE and the Qumran community formed around 150 BCE, that leaves only about 15 years for the book to be written, circulated, accepted as Scripture, copied multiple times, and achieve authoritative status as "the Prophet." Many conservative scholars argue this timeframe is implausibly short. They contend that the Dead Sea Scrolls evidence supports an earlier date of composition, allowing sufficient time for the book to become widely recognized as canonical before the Qumran sect began treating it as such.

Critical scholars respond in several ways: (1) parts of Daniel (especially chapters 1-6) may have been composed earlier and achieved some authoritative status before chapters 7-12 were added; (2) in crisis situations like the Maccabean persecution, texts addressing contemporary needs could achieve rapid acceptance; (3) the Qumran community may have had idiosyncratic views about canon not shared by all Jews; (4) even a few decades might be sufficient for a book to achieve scriptural status in certain communities.

### Canonical Recognition in Early Christianity

The early Christian church universally accepted Daniel as Scripture without question. Jesus's explicit citation of "Daniel the prophet" (Matthew 24:15) provided authoritative validation for Christian communities. The extensive use of Daniel in Revelation and throughout the New Testament demonstrates that the apostolic church regarded it as inspired prophecy about the Messiah and eschatological events.

The Christian Old Testament canon was largely inherited from Greek-speaking Judaism via the Septuagint, which included the Additions to Daniel. This is why Catholic and Orthodox churches, which maintained continuity with early Christian practice, include these additions, while Protestants, following the principle of *sola scriptura* and appealing to the Hebrew canon, exclude them.

### Contemporary Debates

Modern debates about Daniel's canonical status rarely question whether it should be in the Bible at all—all major Christian traditions accept the core Hebrew/Aramaic text as Scripture. Rather, discussions focus on interpretive questions: Should Daniel's placement in the Writings affect how we read it? How should Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians approach the deuterocanonical additions? What does the Dead Sea Scrolls evidence tell us about the dating question?

These questions resist simple answers and reflect broader hermeneutical and theological commitments. For further reading on these issues, see the [Wikipedia article on the Development of the Hebrew Bible Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Hebrew_Bible_canon) and the [Oxford Bibliographies entry on the Additions to Daniel](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0241.xml).

## Summary

The Book of Daniel consists of twelve chapters divided into two distinct sections: court narratives (chapters 1-6) set during the Babylonian and Persian periods, and apocalyptic visions (chapters 7-12) revealing God's sovereign plan for history. Throughout both sections, God's direct interventions, angelic messages, and prophetic revelations emphasize His absolute sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and His faithfulness to His covenant people.

### Chapters 1-6: Court Tales of Faithfulness

**Chapter 1** begins with Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem "in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah" (Daniel 1:1), when "the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand" (Daniel 1:2)—an immediate assertion that even Israel's defeat occurs under God's sovereign control. Young Daniel and his three companions (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, renamed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) are selected for training in the Babylonian court. When faced with ceremonially unclean royal food, Daniel requests permission to eat only vegetables and water. Significantly, "God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs" (Daniel 1:9), and after the ten-day test, God blesses their faithfulness: "God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams" (Daniel 1:17). This divine gifting becomes central to the narrative that follows.

**Chapter 2** presents Nebuchadnezzar's troubling dream, which his magicians and enchanters cannot interpret. Daniel declares that "there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries" (Daniel 2:28) and receives the dream's content and meaning through divine revelation. The dream depicts a great statue with a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, middle and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay (Daniel 2:31-33). God's interpretation through Daniel is explicit: "The God of heaven has given you, O king, the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory" (Daniel 2:37), identifying Nebuchadnezzar as the head of gold. Yet all these kingdoms will be destroyed when "the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed" (Daniel 2:44), represented by a stone "cut out by no human hand" that becomes a great mountain. God's message is unmistakable: earthly empires rise and fall under divine appointment, but God's kingdom will triumph eternally.

**Chapter 3** dramatically illustrates faithfulness unto death when Nebuchadnezzar erects a golden image and commands all to worship it. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse, declaring their allegiance to God alone: "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image" (Daniel 3:17-18). Their faith invites God's direct intervention. When thrown into the superheated furnace, a fourth figure appears—"the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods" (Daniel 3:25). This divine presence, likely a Christophany or angel of the Lord, delivers them completely unharmed, prompting Nebuchadnezzar's acknowledgment: "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him" (Daniel 3:28). The king decrees that no one shall speak against "the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way" (Daniel 3:29).

**Chapter 4**, written as Nebuchadnezzar's own testimony, recounts his second dream of a great tree hewn down with its stump banded, and a decree that "the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will" (Daniel 4:17, 25, 32). This phrase, repeated three times, constitutes God's central message to the proud king. Daniel interprets that Nebuchadnezzar himself is the tree and will be driven from human society until he acknowledges that "the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will" (Daniel 4:25). After twelve months, Nebuchadnezzar boasts "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power?" (Daniel 4:30), and immediately "a voice came from heaven: 'O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you'" (Daniel 4:31). God's judgment strikes instantly; Nebuchadnezzar becomes like a beast for seven periods of time. When his reason returns, he testifies: "I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation" (Daniel 4:34). His final declaration proclaims: "Those who walk in pride he is able to humble" (Daniel 4:37).

**Chapter 5** shifts to Belshazzar's impious feast where sacred Temple vessels are profaned. God responds with direct, supernatural intervention: "Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace" (Daniel 5:5). The mysterious inscription—MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN—contains God's judgment. Daniel interprets God's message: "MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians" (Daniel 5:26-28). That very night, Belshazzar is slain and the kingdom falls (Daniel 5:30-31), demonstrating God's absolute control over the timing and succession of empires.

**Chapter 6** presents Daniel's most famous trial under Darius the Mede. Jealous administrators manipulate Darius into issuing an irrevocable decree that anyone who prays to any god or man except the king for thirty days shall be cast into the lions' den (Daniel 6:7). Daniel continues his practice of praying "toward Jerusalem" three times daily (Daniel 6:10), maintaining covenant faithfulness regardless of consequences. Though distressed, Darius must enforce his decree. Significantly, Darius himself testifies to Daniel's God: "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!" (Daniel 6:16). God indeed intervenes: Daniel reports that "My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him" (Daniel 6:22). The vindication is complete and public. Darius issues a decree throughout his realm: "I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end... He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions" (Daniel 6:26-27).

### Chapters 7-12: Apocalyptic Visions of God's Kingdom

**Chapter 7** transitions to apocalyptic literature with Daniel's night vision of four great beasts emerging from the sea (Daniel 7:1-8), representing successive empires. The vision climaxes with a throne room scene where "the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire" (Daniel 7:9). This majestic description of God emphasizes His eternal nature and judicial authority. "The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened" (Daniel 7:10). Then Daniel sees "one like a son of man" coming "with the clouds of heaven" to the Ancient of Days, and "to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed" (Daniel 7:13-14). An angelic interpreter explains that "the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever" (Daniel 7:18). Despite temporary persecution by an arrogant horn that speaks "words against the Most High" (Daniel 7:25), "the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end. And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High" (Daniel 7:26-27). God's ultimate triumph and the vindication of His people are assured.

**Chapter 8** presents a vision of a ram and goat symbolizing Medo-Persia and Greece, with particular focus on a "little horn" that "grew great, even to the host of heaven" and "took away the regular burnt offering" and "overthrew the place of his sanctuary" (Daniel 8:10-11). A voice asks "For how long is the vision?" and receives the answer: "For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state" (Daniel 8:13-14). The angel Gabriel appears—one of only three times angels are named in the Old Testament—to interpret: this concerns "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17), and specifically "a king of bold face" who "shall destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints" and "shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken—by no human hand" (Daniel 8:24-25). God's intervention, not human resistance, will defeat this persecutor.

**Chapter 9** contains Daniel's magnificent prayer of confession and intercession, prompted by his study of Jeremiah's prophecy of seventy years of desolation (Daniel 9:2). Daniel prays: "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments" (Daniel 9:4). He confesses: "We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules" (Daniel 9:5), yet appeals to God's character: "To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness" (Daniel 9:9). Gabriel appears again with urgent revelation: "Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place" (Daniel 9:24). This enigmatic prophecy, detailing periods leading to an "anointed one" who "shall be cut off and shall have nothing," and predicting that "the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary" (Daniel 9:26), has generated extensive interpretation regarding the Messiah's coming and Jerusalem's destruction.

**Chapters 10-12** comprise Daniel's final and most extensive vision, beginning with an overwhelming appearance of a glorious heavenly being (Daniel 10:5-6) that leaves Daniel without strength (Daniel 10:8). The being, possibly an angel or a Christophany, explains that he was delayed twenty-one days by "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" until "Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me" (Daniel 10:13), revealing spiritual warfare behind earthly events. Michael is identified as "your prince" (Daniel 10:21), protector of Israel. **Chapter 11** provides extraordinary detail about conflicts between "the king of the south" and "the king of the north," wars and alliances that scholars recognize as describing Ptolemaic and Seleucid history with remarkable precision through verse 39. The account focuses especially on one who "shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god," who "shall honor the god of fortresses," and under whom "forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the regular burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate" (Daniel 11:31). **Chapter 12** declares that "at that time Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people, shall arise. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book" (Daniel 12:1). Most significantly, God reveals through the angel the promise of resurrection: "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever" (Daniel 12:2-3). The vision concludes with cryptic time periods—1,290 days and 1,335 days (Daniel 12:11-12)—and a final promise to Daniel: "But go your way till the end. And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days" (Daniel 12:13).

Throughout Daniel, God's sovereignty over history, His faithfulness to His covenant people, His judgment on pride and idolatry, and His promise of ultimate vindication and resurrection form the central theological message, delivered through dreams, visions, angelic interpreters, miraculous deliverances, and prophetic revelations that span from the Babylonian exile to the end of the age.

## Unique Teachings

The Book of Daniel introduces several theological concepts that are either entirely new to the Hebrew Bible or developed to an unprecedented degree, making significant contributions to Jewish and Christian theology.

### Explicit Doctrine of Resurrection for Both Righteous and Wicked

Daniel 12:2 contains the [most explicit and developed teaching on resurrection](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2024/the-eschatology-of-daniel) in the Old Testament: "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (Daniel 12:2). While earlier biblical texts hint at afterlife or use resurrection imagery metaphorically (Isaiah 26:19; Ezekiel 37), Daniel provides the first clear statement of literal, individual bodily resurrection.

Most significantly, Daniel uniquely teaches resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. Previous resurrection passages focused exclusively on the vindication of the righteous, but Daniel reveals that "the wicked are reawakened from the sleep of death" to face judgment. This dual resurrection—some to everlasting life, others to everlasting contempt—became foundational for later Jewish and Christian eschatology. The Pharisees based their belief in resurrection significantly on this passage (Acts 23:8), making it a "major point of contention" between Pharisees and Sadducees. Jesus's own teaching on resurrection (John 5:28-29) closely parallels Daniel 12:2's framework.

The concept of [everlasting life](https://www.study-bible.org/unlocking-the-mystery-of-daniel-122-a-closer-look-at-resurrection-and-everlasting-life/) (*chayyei olam*) as a reward for the righteous also appears here with unprecedented clarity, contrasting sharply with the vague conception of Sheol that dominates most of the Old Testament.

### Named Angels and Developed Angelology

Daniel contains the first instances of [named angels in the Hebrew Bible](https://www.ucg.org/bible-study-tools/booklets/angels-gods-messengers-and-spirit-army/leading-angels-michael-and-gabriel). Only two angels are named in the standard Jewish and Christian biblical canons—Gabriel and Michael—and both appear first in Daniel.

**Gabriel** (meaning "God is my strength") appears in Daniel 8:16 and 9:21 as an interpreter of visions, establishing a pattern continued in Luke's Gospel where Gabriel announces the births of John the Baptist and Jesus (Luke 1:19, 26). His function as revealer of divine mysteries becomes his defining characteristic in subsequent Jewish and Christian tradition.

**Michael** (meaning "Who is like God?") is identified as "one of the chief princes" (Daniel 10:13) and "the great prince who has charge of your people" (Daniel 12:1), specifically serving as protector and advocate for Israel. This portrayal of Michael as warrior-prince and defender established his role in later biblical and extrabiblical literature (Jude 1:9; Revelation 12:7).

Daniel's angelology also introduces a hierarchical structure among angels, with Michael described as "one of the chief princes," implying multiple angelic princes of different ranks. This hierarchical understanding profoundly influenced both Jewish (Dead Sea Scrolls, 1 Enoch) and Christian (Pseudo-Dionysius, medieval angelology) conceptions of the celestial realm.

### Spiritual Warfare and Demonic Princes Over Nations

Closely related to Daniel's angelology is its unique teaching on [spiritual warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_warfare) operating behind earthly political powers. Daniel 10:13, 20-21 reveals that earthly kingdoms have corresponding spiritual "princes"—angelic or demonic beings who represent and influence those nations. The angel tells Daniel: "The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me" (Daniel 10:13). He later mentions "the prince of Greece" (Daniel 10:20).

This concept—that invisible spiritual forces wage war behind visible political conflicts, and that angels of God combat demonic powers associated with pagan nations—appears nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible with such clarity. While other texts acknowledge God's council and spiritual beings (1 Kings 22:19-22; Job 1-2), Daniel uniquely presents a cosmic-political dimension where angels engage in prolonged combat with territorial spirits. This framework became central to intertestamental Jewish apocalyptic literature and Paul's New Testament theology (Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:15).

### The Son of Man as Divine Figure

Daniel 7:13-14's vision of "one like a son of man" coming "with the clouds of heaven" and receiving eternal dominion from the Ancient of Days represents a [unique contribution to messianic theology](https://www.austinwduncan.com/exegetica/the-son-of-man-in-daniel-7/03/07/2025). Unlike the expected human Davidic messiah in other prophetic texts, Daniel presents a figure who:

1. Approaches God in the heavenly throne room (not a human court)
2. Comes with clouds (a divine attribute associated with theophanies)
3. Receives everlasting dominion over all peoples
4. Presides over a kingdom that "shall not pass away" (Daniel 7:14)

Jewish tradition recognized this passage as messianic; [Rashi identified](https://answering-islam.org/authors/shamoun/messiah_sonofman.html) "one like a son of man" as "King Messiah," and the Talmud (Sanhedrin 98a) cited it when discussing the Messiah. However, the figure's divine prerogatives—receiving universal worship, possessing eternal authority, approaching God's throne—transcend typical messianic expectations. This explains why, when Jesus claimed to be this figure before the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:62), the high priest charged him with blasphemy.

The "Son of Man" title, used by Jesus over 80 times in the Gospels, derives entirely from Daniel 7:13. Jesus uniquely combined this glorious apocalyptic figure with the suffering servant of Isaiah 53, creating a synthesis found nowhere in Daniel or prior Jewish interpretation.

### Sequential Kingdoms Leading to God's Eternal Kingdom

While other prophets announced God's coming kingdom, Daniel uniquely presents a detailed schema of successive world empires (Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, and variously interpreted fourth kingdom) that will culminate in God's eternal kingdom. This "four kingdoms" pattern in Daniel 2 and 7 provided the interpretive framework for understanding history as progressing according to divine plan toward a predetermined end.

This periodization of history—dividing it into distinct ages under different powers, all moving toward the eschaton when God establishes His indestructible kingdom—became the dominant model for Jewish apocalyptic literature (1 Enoch, 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch) and Christian eschatology. The concept that current suffering and subordination to pagan powers is temporary and will end with divine intervention gave hope to persecuted communities throughout history.

### Apocalyptic Genre and Sealed Prophecies

Daniel pioneered the full development of [apocalyptic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature) in the Hebrew Bible. While prophetic books contain apocalyptic elements, Daniel systematically employs:

- Symbolic visions requiring angelic interpretation
- Periodization of history into predetermined ages
- Cosmic scope extending beyond Israel to all nations
- Deterministic timeline with specific durations (seventy weeks, 1,260 days, 1,290 days, 1,335 days, 2,300 evenings and mornings)
- Sealed prophecies revealed at the appointed time (Daniel 8:26; 12:4, 9)
- Interest in end-times, resurrection, and final judgment

This distinctive genre, combining visionary experience with historical review presented as prophecy, became the template for later Jewish apocalypses and the New Testament book of Revelation, which extensively draws from Daniel's imagery and structure.

### Cosmic Dualism and Eschatological Judgment

Daniel intensifies the Old Testament's occasional cosmic dualism into a sustained contrast between earthly kingdoms characterized as bestial, chaotic, and arising from the sea (Daniel 7:3) versus God's kingdom represented by a human figure from heaven. This vertical dualism (earth vs. heaven) combines with temporal dualism (present age vs. age to come) to create a comprehensive worldview where the present evil age will be decisively replaced by God's eternal reign.

The imagery of courtroom judgment with opened books (Daniel 7:10), the weighing and finding wanting (Daniel 5:27), and the sorting of humanity into eternal destinies (Daniel 12:2) presents eschatological judgment more vividly and systematically than other Old Testament texts, establishing categories that Jesus and the New Testament writers extensively developed.

For further reading on Daniel's unique theological contributions, see [Biola's overview of Daniel's eschatology](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2024/the-eschatology-of-daniel) and scholarly discussions of [the divine nature of the Son of Man figure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358372680_Why_the_Danielic_Son_of_Man_Is_a_Divine_Being).

## Textual Variants

The text of Daniel presents unusual complexities in its transmission history, existing in multiple substantially different versions that diverge more significantly than most other biblical books. These variants primarily involve the relationship between the Hebrew-Aramaic Masoretic Text, the Old Greek Septuagint, the revision known as Theodotion, and the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) manuscripts.

### The Three Main Textual Witnesses

Daniel is preserved in three distinct textual editions that "at times vastly diverge from one another": the [Masoretic Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text) (MT) in Hebrew and Aramaic, the Old Greek (OG, also called the Septuagint of Daniel), and the Theodotionic edition—both Greek translations that differ significantly from each other and from the MT.

The Old Greek generally employs a freer translation method, exhibiting significant syntactical divergence from the Hebrew-Aramaic original, with creative paraphrasing and explanatory additions. Theodotion, by contrast, provides a more literal, word-for-word rendering that closely follows the Semitic text. Recent scholarship argues that Theodotion-Daniel represents "a systematic revision of the Old Greek in conformity with a Semitic text form which often preserved original readings against the Masoretic Text and the Qumran scrolls," suggesting that Theodotion sometimes reflects an earlier, superior Hebrew-Aramaic Vorlage.

### The Unique Replacement of the Old Greek

What makes Daniel exceptional among biblical books is that "somewhere in the history of the Greek Bible the Septuagint of Daniel was replaced by Theodotion...as the authoritative Greek version." This substitution occurred in Christian manuscript tradition by the 2nd-3rd centuries CE. Church father Origen noted this phenomenon, and by Jerome's time (late 4th century), Theodotion had become the standard. The original Old Greek version survived primarily in a single manuscript (Codex Chisianus) and in the Syrohexapla (a Syriac translation of Origen's Hexapla).

The reasons for this unprecedented replacement remain debated. Some scholars suggest the Old Greek's significant divergences from the Hebrew made it unsuitable for Jewish-Christian apologetic debates, while others propose that Theodotion's greater literalism better served liturgical and study purposes.

### Major Textual Differences in Chapters 3-6

The divergences between these versions appear throughout Daniel but concentrate especially in chapters 3-6, the court narrative section. "The Septuagint version of the book diverges from the Masoretic Text in significant ways, especially, but not only, in chapters 3-6." These differences include:

- **Different narrative details**: The OG and MT sometimes describe events differently, with variations in dialogue, sequence of actions, and narrative elements.
- **Expansions and contractions**: The Greek versions contain material absent from the MT, while occasionally the MT includes elements missing from the Greek.
- **Theological adjustments**: Some variants appear to clarify theological points or resolve potential difficulties in the narrative.

Scholars studying Daniel 5 and Daniel 6 have documented extensive variants in vocabulary, syntax, and narrative structure that go far beyond normal translation differences, raising complex questions about the relationship between the Hebrew and Greek traditions.

### The Deuterocanonical Additions

Both Greek versions (OG and Theodotion) contain three substantial additions entirely absent from the Hebrew-Aramaic Masoretic Text:

1. **The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children**: Inserted between Daniel 3:23 and 3:24, this 68-verse addition (Daniel 3:24-90 in Greek numbering) includes a penitential prayer by Azariah (Abednego) and a hymn of praise sung by all three youths while in the fiery furnace. The prayer confesses Israel's sins and appeals to God's mercy, while the song calls all creation to bless the Lord.

2. **Susanna**: A self-contained narrative about Daniel as a young man demonstrating wisdom by exposing two corrupt elders who falsely accused the virtuous Susanna of adultery. This appears before Daniel 1:1 in the Old Greek tradition but was placed as chapter 13 in Theodotion and the Vulgate.

3. **Bel and the Dragon**: Two stories demonstrating the folly of idol worship—Daniel proves that priests, not the idol Bel, consume the offerings, and Daniel destroys a living dragon worshipped as divine. Appears after Daniel 12:13 in Greek manuscripts, designated as chapter 14 in Theodotion and the Vulgate.

"To this day we have no evidence of their existence in Hebrew or Aramaic," despite extensive searches among the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient sources. Whether these additions were originally composed in a Semitic language and subsequently lost, or composed directly in Greek, remains uncertain. Most scholars lean toward original Semitic composition based on Semitisms in the Greek text, though the linguistic evidence is debated.

Eastern Orthodox churches accept these additions as fully canonical; Roman Catholics recognize them as deuterocanonical (secondary canon); Protestants exclude them from the biblical canon, sometimes including them in Apocrypha sections.

### Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls

Eight Daniel manuscripts were discovered at Qumran: 1QDana, 1QDanb, 4QDana, 4QDanb, 4QDanc, 4QDand, 4QDane, and pap6QDan. The oldest, 4QDanc, has been radiocarbon dated to the late 2nd century BCE, making these among the oldest surviving biblical manuscripts.

These manuscripts demonstrate remarkable textual stability: "The eight Dead Sea scroll Daniel manuscripts are very close to each other" and "conform closely to later Masoretic tradition." This general agreement provides strong evidence for the careful preservation of Daniel's Hebrew-Aramaic text. However, "some rare variants side with the Alexandrian Greek (Septuagint) against the MT and Theodotion," indicating that the Qumran scribes sometimes preserved readings that differ from the later standardized Masoretic tradition.

The variants in the Qumran manuscripts are relatively minor: "There is no significant abbreviation and no lengthy expansion in any of the manuscript fragments. The chief differences have to do with the spelling of words"—orthographic variations typical of Hebrew manuscript transmission. Notably, none of the Qumran manuscripts contain any trace of the deuterocanonical additions, supporting the conclusion that these are later Greek compositions or traditions.

### Scholarly Disagreement

Despite over two centuries of scholarly investigation, "the relationship of these three editions of the book of Daniel has been disputed...and a scholarly consensus has not yet been reached." Key questions remain unsolved:

- Which textual tradition most accurately reflects the original composition?
- Was there a single original Hebrew-Aramaic text, or did multiple Hebrew editions exist from early times?
- Do the Old Greek variants represent alternative Hebrew sources, free translation, or theological revision?
- When and why were the deuterocanonical additions composed and inserted into the Greek tradition?

The complexity of Daniel's textual tradition likely reflects the book's composition during a period of transition (whether 6th century exile or 2nd century persecution), its multilingual nature (Hebrew and Aramaic sections), and its use across diverse Jewish communities (Palestine and diaspora) during the Hellenistic period when translation practices were still developing.

For technical analysis of these variants, see [Oxford Bibliographies on the Additions to Daniel](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0241.xml) and scholarly discussions at [Spirit and Truth on Daniel versions](https://www.spiritandtruth.org/teaching/Book_of_Daniel/commentary/htm/intro/versions.html).

## Textual Errors

The Book of Daniel presents several historical and chronological difficulties that have generated extensive scholarly discussion. Critical scholars view these as errors pointing to late composition by an author distant from the events described, while conservative scholars offer explanations that preserve historical reliability. Understanding these issues requires examining both the problems and the proposed solutions.

### The Darius the Mede Problem

The most substantial historical difficulty involves [Darius the Mede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Mede), who appears prominently in Daniel 5:31-6:28 as the king who conquered Babylon and ruled before Cyrus. The text states: "And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old" (Daniel 5:31). Yet "there is no space in the historical timeline" between Belshazzar and Cyrus for such a ruler. Secular historical records, including the Nabonidus Chronicle and Uruk King List, show that Cyrus the Persian conquered Babylon in 539 BCE and immediately became king. No Median king named Darius ruled Babylon, and indeed, Media had been absorbed into the Persian Empire by Cyrus' father, Cambyses I, decades earlier.

Modern critical scholars conclude that "Darius the Mede...is generally seen today as a literary fiction"—a confused memory or deliberate literary construction reflecting the author's imperfect knowledge of 6th century history. H. H. Rowley's influential 1935 study argued that Darius the Mede "cannot be identified with any king" known to history.

Conservative scholars have proposed several identifications:

**Cyrus himself**: Some suggest Darius was an alternative name or throne name for Cyrus, paralleling how one king might bear multiple titles. This view struggles with the text's clear distinction between Darius and Cyrus (Daniel 6:28; 10:1).

**Gubaru/Gobryas**: The Nabonidus Chronicle mentions that Cyrus "appointed Gubaru as governor of Babylon immediately after the city was conquered." Some identify this Gubaru (or Gobryas in Greek sources) as Darius the Mede, suggesting he served as Cyrus' appointed governor with the title "king" as a courtesy. This requires understanding "king" (Daniel 5:31; 6:6, 9, etc.) as meaning "governor."

**Cyaxares II**: Xenophon's *Cyropaedia* (a largely fictional historical romance) describes a Median king named Cyaxares II who supposedly reigned alongside Cyrus and was Cyrus' uncle and father-in-law. Some conservative scholars identify this figure with Darius, though Xenophon is alone among ancient historians in mentioning Cyaxares II, and *Cyropaedia* is known to contain historical inaccuracies.

None of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance. The identification remains problematic regardless of one's view on Daniel's dating.

### Daniel 1:1 Chronological Problem

Daniel begins: "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it" (Daniel 1:1). This statement presents multiple historical difficulties:

**Nebuchadnezzar's Royal Title**: "The third year of Jehoiakim's reign was 606 BCE, at which time Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king of Babylon." Nabopolassar ruled Babylon until 605 BCE, when Nebuchadnezzar succeeded him. How could Nebuchadnezzar be called "king of Babylon" in 606 BCE?

**Discrepancy with Jeremiah**: Jeremiah 25:1 explicitly states: "The fourth year of Jehoiakim...was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon." If Nebuchadnezzar's first regnal year was Jehoiakim's fourth year, he could not have besieged Jerusalem as king in Jehoiakim's third year.

**Lack of Deportation Evidence**: Historians have found "no known siege or deportation" in 607/606 BCE, though Nebuchadnezzar (as crown prince, not yet king) did conduct military campaigns to the Levant in 605 BCE.

Conservative scholars resolve these issues by appealing to different calendar systems and throne-counting methods:

**Calendar Reckoning**: Ancient Near Eastern kingdoms used two primary calendar systems—one beginning in spring (Nisan calendar, used in Babylon) and one in fall (Tishri calendar, traditional in Judah). "The discrepancy can be resolved by assuming that Daniel used the old calendar year in Judah which began in the fall...and that Jeremiah used the Babylonian calendar which began in the spring." Under this system, what Jeremiah calls Jehoiakim's fourth year (Nisan reckoning) would be Jehoiakim's third year under Tishri reckoning, eliminating the contradiction.

**Accession Year System**: Babylon employed an "accession year" system where a king's first partial year wasn't counted as year one, while Judah sometimes used a non-accession system. Accounting for this explains the one-year difference between Daniel and Jeremiah.

**Proleptic Title**: Some suggest Daniel anachronistically calls Nebuchadnezzar "king" even though he was crown prince in 605 BCE, since he soon became king. This was a common ancient practice of granting titles retrospectively.

Critical scholars find these explanations strained, arguing that a 6th century author contemporary with events would not create such confusion, whereas a 2nd century author might conflate details from multiple sources and time periods.

### Historical Vindications

Significantly, archaeology has vindicated Daniel on points where scholars once claimed error. For centuries, Belshazzar was known only from Daniel and was dismissed as fictional. "Persian propaganda had successfully erased Belshazzar...from history, except as his name was preserved in the Bible." Then 19th century cuneiform discoveries revealed that "Belshazzar was king in Babylon in 539 BC, just as commemorated in the Book of Daniel," serving as coregent with his father Nabonidus. This dramatic vindication counsels caution about too quickly dismissing Daniel's historical claims based on silence in secular sources.

### Language Issues

Daniel's use of both Hebrew (chapters 1, 8-12) and Aramaic (chapters 2-7) has prompted linguistic analysis. Critical scholars once argued that Daniel's Aramaic was too late for the 6th century, pointing to the 2nd century. However, subsequent discoveries of earlier Aramaic texts, particularly among the Dead Sea Scrolls, have demonstrated that Daniel's Aramaic is consistent with the 5th-4th centuries BCE, though it could also fit the 2nd century. The linguistic evidence thus permits either early or late dating, though it doesn't require late dating as once claimed.

Daniel also contains three Greek loanwords (*qāterôs*, *pĕsantêrîn*, *sûmĕpōnyâh* in Daniel 3:5) referring to musical instruments. Critical scholars point to these as evidence of Hellenistic-period composition (post-Alexander). Conservative scholars respond that Greek trade with the Near East existed as early as the 8th century BCE, making Greek loanwords plausible in 6th century Babylon. The issue remains debated.

For further discussion of these historical problems and proposed solutions, see the detailed analysis at [Evidence Unseen on Darius the Mede](https://www.evidenceunseen.com/bible-difficulties-2/ot-difficulties/daniel-amos/dan-531-who-is-darius-the-mede/) and [Focus Magazine's examination of Daniel's historical accuracy](https://focusmagazine.org/belshazzar-and-darius-the-mede-was-daniel-wrong.php).

## Contradictions

Beyond external historical questions, Daniel contains several apparent internal contradictions and tensions with other biblical texts that require explanation.

### Daniel 1:21 Versus Daniel 10:1

The most frequently noted internal contradiction concerns Daniel's lifespan. Daniel 1:21 states: "And Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus," seeming to indicate that Daniel's service or life ended in Cyrus' first year (539 BCE). Yet Daniel 10:1 clearly places Daniel receiving a vision "in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia" (536 BCE). How can Daniel "continue until the first year of Cyrus" and yet receive visions two years later?

Multiple solutions have been proposed:

**"Until" as Milestone, Not Terminus**: Most commentators understand Daniel 1:21 as marking a significant historical milestone rather than Daniel's death or retirement. "The meaning is that Daniel lived during the entire exilic period and into the reign of Cyrus II." The verse emphasizes that Daniel survived from the beginning of the Babylonian captivity all the way until its end—marked by Cyrus' decree permitting Jewish return (Ezra 1:1). "The first year of Cyrus marked the end of Babylonian captivity, not the end of Daniel's life."

**Hebrew Linguistic Nuance**: Daniel 1:21 uses *vayehi* ("he was/continued"), not *vayechi* ("he lived"), possibly suggesting "Daniel continued his duty in Babylon until Cyrus rose to power, then moved to Persia where he saw his final vision."

**Literary Structure**: Chapter 1 serves as a prologue spanning Daniel's entire career from his youth to old age. Verse 21 provides bookends showing Daniel's remarkable longevity through the entire exile, without implying he died precisely in Cyrus' first year.

This is generally not regarded as a genuine contradiction, as the verse's intent is clearly to emphasize Daniel's longevity through momentous historical changes rather than to specify his death date.

### The "Seventy Years" Interpretation

Daniel 9:2 records that Daniel "understood from the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years." Daniel interprets Jeremiah's prophecy (Jeremiah 25:11-12; 29:10) as referring to the desolation of Jerusalem. However, historical scrutiny reveals complexity: the temple was destroyed in 586 BCE and rebuilt in 516 BCE (exactly seventy years), but Jerusalem's "desolations" in a broader sense continued longer, and Babylon's seventy years of dominance could be counted differently depending on starting points (conquest of Assyria 609 BCE, Battle of Carchemish 605 BCE, or deportation 597 BCE).

This doesn't constitute a contradiction so much as an interpretive question about how to count the seventy years. Daniel himself seems to recognize this ambiguity, as his prayer in Daniel 9 acknowledges that the time should have been fulfilled but Jerusalem remained in ruins, prompting Gabriel's revelation of the "seventy weeks" extending the timeframe.

### Nebuchadnezzar's Madness Duration

Daniel 4 describes Nebuchadnezzar's seven-year period of madness ("seven times" or "seven periods," Daniel 4:23, 25, 32), during which he lived like an animal. Yet no Babylonian historical records mention this incident, and it seems implausible that such a significant event would go unrecorded. This is often cited as evidence against historicity.

Conservative responses note that:
- Ancient royal records regularly suppressed embarrassing information
- Nabonidus (Nabopolassar's successor but not Nebuchadnezzar's immediate successor) did leave Babylon for ten years, living in Arabia—some scholars suggest Daniel may have conflated or confused details about these two kings
- The "seven times" may not mean seven full years but could be a symbolic or shorter period

However, the absence of corroborating evidence remains a difficulty for those who affirm the historical accuracy of every detail.

### Daniel's Age and Career Length

If Daniel was taken to Babylon as a youth in 605 BCE (Daniel 1:3-4) and received his final vision in the third year of Cyrus (536 BCE), his career spanned at least 69 years. Add his age when captured (likely 15-18 as a young noble), and Daniel would be approximately 84-87 years old or older in chapter 10. While not impossible, this requires Daniel to have maintained remarkable mental and physical capacity well into advanced age. Some see this as stretching credibility, though the text explicitly presents Daniel as chosen for exceptional qualities (Daniel 1:4), and longevity per se is not miraculous in biblical narratives.

### Apparent Contradiction with Historical Succession of Empires

Daniel's four-kingdom schema (Daniel 2, 7) has been interpreted in multiple ways, leading to debates about whether it accurately reflects historical succession. If the kingdoms are Babylon, Media, Persia, and Greece (as critical scholars argue), then the separation of Media and Persia as distinct empires contradicts historical reality, since they formed a unified Medo-Persian Empire under Cyrus. If the kingdoms are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome (traditional Christian interpretation), this fits history better but requires identifying the fourth beast of Daniel 7 with Rome, which goes unmentioned in the text.

The ambiguity in identifying the empires creates interpretive difficulties rather than clear contradictions, but it demonstrates the challenges in correlating Daniel's symbolic visions with precise historical referents.

These contradictions and difficulties underscore the interpretive challenges Daniel presents. Whether one views them as genuine errors pointing to late composition, as problems resulting from gaps in our historical knowledge, or as theological history that prioritizes message over precise chronology depends substantially on one's prior assumptions about biblical inspiration and historical method.
