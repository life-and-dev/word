# The Gospels

The Gospels are the first four books of the New Testament in the Christian Bible. They are the Gospel of:
1. [Matthew](gospels/matthew.md)
2. Mark
3. Luke
4. John

The purpose of the Gospels is to convey the good news of Jesus, which reveals the character of [God the Father](https://ofgod.info) and the [Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info).

This message will carry no authority unless the Gospel witnesses could prove that Jesus was indeed the promised [Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ).

Therefore, the Gospel witnesses provide accounts of the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Each Gospel offers a unique perspective and emphasis, reflecting the distinct audiences and theological intentions of their authors.

## Historical Environment

The Gospels were written during a critical and tumultuous period in Jewish and early Christian history, spanning from approximately 60-100 CE. This era was marked by intense political oppression, religious conflict, and social upheaval that profoundly shaped how the Gospel writers presented Jesus's life and message.

**Roman Occupation and Political Climate**: First-century Palestine suffered under Roman occupation, characterized by the brutal reign of Herod the Great and direct Roman governance by prefects like Pontius Pilate. This subjugation fueled intense messianic expectations among the Jewish people, who anticipated a king to restore Israel's political sovereignty. Jewish culture was shaped by various religious sects, including the Pharisees and Sadducees, who frequently appear in the Gospel narratives as Jesus's opponents.

**The Destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (70 CE)**: A watershed moment occurred with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War. For gospels written before this event (possibly Mark in the mid-to-late 60s CE), the narrative captures the turmoil and tension preceding the war. For gospels written after (Matthew, Luke, and John, composed in the 80s-100 CE), the catastrophic loss of the Temple fundamentally reshaped both Judaism and Christianity. This trauma explains the conflict between emerging Christian communities and rabbinic Judaism, as both groups claimed to be the true continuation of Israel's heritage.

**Persecution and Suffering**: The Gospel of Mark, likely written in Rome during Emperor Nero's intense persecution of Christians in the mid-to-late 60s CE, reflects an urgent tone and emphasizes suffering discipleship. The call to "take up one's cross" would have resonated deeply with communities facing martyrdom. This context of persecution provided theological grounding for believers enduring hardship by presenting Jesus's own suffering as the path to glory.

**Church-Synagogue Separation**: By the time of John's composition (around 90-100 CE in Ephesus), a painful, ongoing separation between church and synagogue was well underway. The Gospel addresses this crisis by presenting Jesus as the new temple and the fulfillment of Jewish festivals, offering theological comfort to believers experiencing expulsion from their ancestral religious community.

**Diverse Audiences and Theological Challenges**: The Gospels were written for diverse audiences across the Mediterranean world—Jewish Christians in Palestine (Matthew), Gentile Christians in Rome (Mark), Greek-speaking Gentiles (Luke), and a mixed Jewish-Gentile community in Asia Minor (John). Each community faced unique challenges, from explaining Jewish customs to Gentile believers unfamiliar with Palestinian Judaism, to addressing proto-Gnostic ideas and competing claims about figures like John the Baptist.

This historical backdrop is essential for understanding why each Gospel presents Jesus differently while maintaining the core message: Jesus is the promised [Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ) who redefines messianic expectations, emphasizing spiritual redemption over political revolution, and establishing [the Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info) through suffering, death, and resurrection.

## Authorship and Audience

- **Matthew**: Traditionally attributed to Matthew, a tax collector and one of Jesus' twelve apostles. It is often considered to be written for a Jewish-Christian audience, with the purpose to demonstrate conclusively that Jesus is the promised [Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecy](https://prophecies.ofgod.info) and [establishes the Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info).
- **Mark**: Believed to be written by John Mark, a companion of the apostle Peter. It is directed towards a Roman audience, highlighting Jesus' actions and miracles.
- **Luke**: Attributed to Luke, a physician and companion of the apostle Paul. It is addressed to a Gentile audience and emphasizes Jesus' compassion and inclusivity.
- **John**: Traditionally attributed to John, the "beloved disciple." It is a personal testimony "so that you may believe that Jesus is [the Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ), [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31).

## Contradictions

While the Gospels share many similarities, they also contain differences in details and emphasis. These variations can be attributed to the distinct perspectives of the authors, their intended audiences, and the specific theological messages they sought to convey. However, these differences do not undermine the overall message of the Gospels but rather enrich our understanding of Jesus' life and ministry.

### The Genealogies of Jesus (Matthew 1:1-17 cf. Luke 3:23-38)

While Mark and John contain no genealogy, those in Matthew and Luke differ significantly. Both genealogies agree from Abraham to David (Matthew 1:2-6; Luke 3:31-34) but diverge afterward, creating several points of tension:

#### The Contradictions

*   **Paternal Line**: Matthew states Joseph's father was **Jacob** (Matthew 1:16), while Luke identifies him as **Heli** (Luke 3:23).
*   **Davidic Ancestry**: Matthew traces Jesus' line from David through his son **Solomon** (Matthew 1:6; cf. 1 Chronicles 3:5), while Luke traces it through David's other son, **Nathan** (Luke 3:31; cf. 1 Chronicles 3:5).
*   **Number of Generations**: Matthew lists **28 generations** from David to Jesus (Matthew 1:17), while Luke lists **41 generations** (Luke 3:23-31).
*   **List of Names**: The two lists of names between David and Joseph are almost entirely different, with only Shealtiel and Zerubbabel appearing in both (Matthew 1:12; Luke 3:27).

#### Proposed Resolutions

* **Mary's Lineage**: Luke's genealogy traces **Mary's line**, while Matthew's traces **Joseph's**. This would make Heli the father of Mary (and thus Jesus' maternal grandfather), with Luke calling Joseph "son of Heli" because he was Heli's son-in-law. This explanation would mean Matthew provides Jesus' **legal, royal lineage** through Joseph (establishing legal claim to David's throne via Solomon's royal line), while Luke provides Jesus' **biological lineage through Mary** (explaining His physical Davidic descent through Nathan).

* **Levirate Marriage**: The differences could be explained by levirate marriage customs (Deuteronomy 25:5-6), where a man would marry his deceased brother's widow to produce an heir for his brother. This could create two different "fathers"—one biological and one legal. Under this view, Jacob and Heli were brothers (or half-brothers), and Joseph was the biological son of one but the legal son of the other.

* **Theological Constructions**: Many critical scholars view the genealogies not as historical records but as theological constructions shaped by each author's purpose:
    *   **Matthew's genealogy** aims to establish Jesus' legal claim to the throne of David through the royal line of Solomon, **addressing Jewish concerns about messianic credentials**. His structured presentation of three sets of fourteen generations (Matthew 1:17) emphasizes divine ordering of history.
    *   **Luke's genealogy** may emphasize a different kind of Davidic ancestry or trace Jesus' lineage all the way back to Adam (Luke 3:38) to underscore his role as **the savior of all humanity**, not just the Jews. This fits Luke's universal emphasis throughout his Gospel.

### The Voice at Jesus' Baptism (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22)

A grammatical difference exists in the reporting of the voice from heaven at Jesus' baptism.
*   Mark and Luke record a direct, second-person address to Jesus: "**You are** My beloved Son..." (Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22).
*   Matthew records a third-person proclamation to the crowd: "**This is** My beloved Son..." (Matthew 3:17).

This variation reflects the different theological emphases of the authors, rather than a contradiction in the event itself.
*   **Mark's account**, with its direct address to Jesus, fits his theme of the "messianic secret" and the private revelation of Jesus' identity.
*   **Matthew's account**, with its public declaration, aligns with his purpose of presenting Jesus as the publicly recognized Messiah and King of Israel.

Both statements could have been made, or they may represent different translations or interpretations of the same divine event, each shaped to fit the author's specific narrative purpose. The core message ***that God the Father affirmed Jesus as His Son*** remains identical in all accounts.

### The Centurion's Servant (Matthew 8:5-13 cf. Luke 7:1-10)

> When he [Jesus] had entered Capernaum, a centurion **came forward to him**, appealing... — Matthew 8:5 (ESV)

Matthew states the centurion "came forward to him" directly requesting healing, while Luke records the centurion "sent to him elders of the Jews" (Luke 7:3) and later "sent friends" (Luke 7:6). Critics claim this demonstrates *irreconcilable contradiction* because either the centurion came personally or sent intermediaries, not both. 

Conservative response invokes the ancient law of agency: emissaries acting on another's authority were legally and socially **regarded as equivalent to the principal himself acting**. Numerous biblical examples demonstrate this principle: 2 Samuel 3:18, 14:19; 2 Kings 14:27; Esther 8:8; Ezra 1:7-8. When authorized representatives speak, ancient literature attributes speech directly to the one who authorized them. Matthew employs narrative compression (telescoping), a common ancient literary technique omitting intermediary details to focus on principals; Luke, who explicitly claims thorough investigation (Luke 1:3), includes fuller circumstantial detail. Both accounts could remain historically accurate: the centurion did approach Jesus (through authorized representatives), and intermediaries were physically present. Neither Matthew nor Luke claims exclusivity contradicting the other; they simply emphasize different aspects according to their distinct purposes and audiences.

### The Death of Jairus's Daughter (Matthew 9:18 cf. Mark 5:23)

When the synagogue ruler Jairus approaches Jesus, a factual contradiction emerges between Matthew's and Mark's accounts.
*   In Mark, Jairus states his daughter is "at the point of death" (Mark 5:23), and messengers later arrive to announce, "Your daughter is dead" (Mark 5:35).
*   In Matthew, Jairus reports from the very beginning, "My daughter has just died" (Matthew 9:18).

This discrepancy is best explained by recognizing the different literary goals of the authors.
*   **Mark's account** is more detailed and dramatic, building narrative tension by having the news of the death arrive while Jesus is on his way.
*   **Matthew's account** is a compressed summary of the event. He prioritizes narrative economy over chronological detail, collapsing the initial request and the subsequent news of death into a single statement to get to the main point: Jesus' power over death.

### The Blind Man at Jericho (Matthew 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)

Mark identifies **one blind beggar**, Bartimaeus, healed as Jesus left Jericho (Mark 10:46-52). Matthew's parallel reports **two blind men** healed as Jesus left Jericho (Matthew 20:29-34). Luke places the healing of **one blind man** as Jesus approached Jericho (Luke 18:35-43). These accounts contain three points of tension: 

1. the number of blind men (one vs. two), 
2. the location (leaving vs. approaching), and 
3. the name (Bartimaeus identified vs. unnamed). 

Harmonization attempts propose: 

1. two blind men were present, but Mark and Luke focus on the more prominent or vocal one (Bartimaeus), explaining the numerical difference; 
2. the healing occurred between old and new Jericho (separated by about a mile), allowing both "leaving" and "approaching" to be technically accurate from different reference points; 
3. Bartimaeus alone called out initially (as Jesus approached), with both men healed as Jesus departed, accounting for various elements. 

### The Timing of the Temple Cleansing (Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:12-21; John 2:13-17)

The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) place Jesus' temple cleansing during Passion Week, shortly before his arrest (Matthew 21:12-13, Mark 11:15-19). However, John places a temple cleansing at the very beginning of Jesus' ministry, approximately three years earlier (John 2:13-22). This creates a stark **chronological contradiction**.

Proposed resolutions include:
1.  **Two Cleansings**: Jesus cleansed the temple twice—once at the beginning of his ministry (John's account) and again at the end (Synoptic account), demonstrating consistent zeal for His Father's house.
2.  **Theological Arrangement**: John, prioritizing theology over strict chronology, placed the event early to establish Jesus' authority and to foreshadow the resurrection ("destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up," John 2:19) from the outset of his Gospel.
3.  **Synoptic Relocation**: The Synoptics may have relocated an earlier cleansing event to Passion Week to heighten the narrative tension and provide a direct catalyst for the plot to arrest Jesus.

Scholars generally favor options (2) or (3), noting that a confrontational act of such magnitude would likely have prompted an immediate and severe response, making a repeat occurrence less plausible. This variation illustrates how Gospel writers often prioritized theological meaning and narrative structure over a strictly chronological sequence of events.

### The Cursing of the Fig Tree (Matthew 21:19 cf. Mark 11:12-14, 20-21)

A timing difference exists between Matthew and Mark regarding the withering of the fig tree. Matthew records the fig tree withering "at once" (Matthew 21:19), immediately after Jesus cursed it. Mark, however, states that the disciples only noticed it had withered overnight on the following morning (Mark 11:12-14, 20-21).

This is generally resolved by noting the authors' different literary techniques:
*   **Matthew compresses the event into a single narrative** for theological emphasis, focusing on the immediate power of Jesus' word and the instantaneous judgment on Israel's lack of fruit.
*   **Mark provides a fuller chronological detail**, separating the curse from the discovery of its effect to create narrative suspense.

Both accounts can be seen as accurate from different perspectives. The tree did begin to wither "at once" (immediately upon Jesus' curse), even if the visible evidence of it being "withered from the roots" was not observed by the disciples until the next morning.

### The Last Supper and Passover Timing (Matthew 26:17-20; Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7-15; John 13:1, 18:28, 19:14)

One of the most significant chronological contradictions concerns the timing of the Last Supper.
*   The Synoptic Gospels identify the Last Supper as a Passover meal, with Jesus crucified on the day of Passover (Mark 14:12-17; Matthew 26:17-20; Luke 22:7-15).
*   John's Gospel places the Last Supper *before* Passover, with Jesus crucified on the day of preparation, at the same time the Passover lambs were being slaughtered in the temple (John 13:1, 18:28, 19:14).

This creates a fundamental conflict: Jesus either ate the Passover meal before his death (Synoptics) or died before the meal began (John).

Proposed resolutions include:
1.  **Different Calendars**: The Synoptics may have followed a calendar (e.g., from Qumran or an alternative Galilean tradition) that celebrated Passover on a different day than the official Jerusalem priesthood, which John's account follows.
2.  **Theological Chronology**: John may have deliberately altered the chronology to make a theological point: portraying Jesus as the true Passover Lamb, who was sacrificed at the exact moment the lambs were being prepared for the feast.
3.  **A Non-Passover Meal**: The Synoptic writers may have theologically identified what was originally a simple final meal with the Passover feast because of its redemptive significance, even if it did not occur on the precise date.

Critical scholars generally view John's chronology as a theological construction to achieve the "Jesus as Passover Lamb" symbolism. This contradiction significantly impacts any historical reconstruction of Jesus' final days.

### The Son of Man Betrayal Prophecy (Matthew 26:24 cf. Mark 14:21)

Both Mark and Matthew record Jesus stating, "The Son of Man goes as it is written of him" (Mark 14:21; Matthew 26:24), referring to his betrayal by Judas. However, there is **no single, clear Old Testament prophecy that explicitly predicts the Messiah will be betrayed by a friend for a specific amount of silver**.

This raises the question of what "as it is written" refers to.
   
Conservative scholars propose that this refers not to a single verse, but to a **composite fulfillment** of multiple prophetic themes found across the Old Testament, including:
    *   **Psalm 41:9**: Betrayal by an intimate friend ("Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.").
    *   **Zechariah 11:12-13**: The price of thirty pieces of silver and the money being thrown "to the potter."
    *   **Isaiah 53**: The general theme of the Suffering Servant who is "despised and rejected."

In this view, "as it is written" refers to the way Jesus' betrayal fulfilled a *pattern* of prophetic types and shadows, rather than a single, explicit prediction. The Gospels reference a convergence of themes that, when combined, point to the events of the passion.

### The Resurrection Accounts (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:4-10; John 20:1-12)

The most frequently cited contradictions concern resurrection morning details. Critics note: 

* Matthew mentions "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary" (Matthew 28:1), 
* Mark adds Salome (Mark 16:1), 
* Luke names "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women" (Luke 24:10), 
* John focuses solely on Mary Magdalene (John 20:1). 

Regarding angels, 

* Matthew records one angel (Matthew 28:2-5), 
* Mark one young man (Mark 16:5), 
* Luke two men (Luke 24:4),
* John two angels (John 20:12). 

Conservative harmonization recognizes that none of these accounts claims exclusivity. 

Matthew and Mark **focus on the spokesperson angel** who delivered the primary message, while Luke and John **mention both angels present**. 

Regarding women, Matthew and Mark provide **abbreviated lists** while Luke offers **more complete enumeration** and John **spotlights Mary Magdalene's experience without denying others' presence**. Ancient biographical writing commonly selected details supporting authorial purpose rather than exhaustively cataloging every participant. Furthermore, **multiple women likely made multiple trips** to the tomb that morning, with **different Gospel writers focusing on different visits or different groups**. 

Additionally, Mark's account of the women's response presents an internal tension and a conflict with other Gospels. The angel commands the women, "But go, **tell his disciples and Peter**..." (Mark 16:7), yet the narrative concludes, "...and **they said nothing to anyone**, for they were afraid" (Mark 16:8). This appears to contradict both the angel's command and the other Gospels, which state the women immediately went to tell the disciples (Matthew 28:8; Luke 24:9).

Proposed resolutions include:
* "said nothing to anyone" means they **told no one except the disciples**, remaining silent to outsiders but delivering the message to its intended recipients.
* **They said nothing immediately or on the way back**, but subsequently told the disciples after their initial fear subsided.
* **Mark's abrupt ending is a deliberate literary device** that leaves the tension unresolved, forcing the reader to recognize that the women *must* have eventually spoken (otherwise the Gospel would not exist) and thus emphasizing their initial, very human fear.

The core agreement remains unshaken: 

* the tomb was empty, 
* angels announced Jesus' resurrection, 
* women encountered the risen Lord, 
* disciples verified the empty tomb. 

Differences in peripheral details actually strengthen rather than undermine historical reliability because fabricated accounts typically demonstrate suspicious uniformity, while authentic independent testimony naturally varies in perspective and detail selection while agreeing on essentials.

### The Great Commission's Location (Matthew 28:16-20; Luke 24:36-51; Acts 1:4-12; John 20:19-21, 21:1-23)

The final, climactic commissioning of the disciples by the risen Jesus (the "Great Commission") occurs in different locations across the Gospels, creating a geographical contradiction.
*   In **Matthew**, the commission takes place on a mountain in **Galilee** (Matthew 28:16-20).
*   In **Luke/Acts**, the final instructions and ascension happen in and around **Jerusalem/Bethany** (Luke 24:36-51; Acts 1:4-12).
*   **John** records appearances in both Jerusalem (John 20:19-21) and Galilee (John 21:1-23).

Harmonization proposes that **Jesus gave multiple commissions in different locations over the forty days** between his resurrection and ascension—a Galilean appearance followed by a return to Jerusalem for the final ascension.
