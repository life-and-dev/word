# Psalms

The Book of Psalms stands as a timeless collection of sacred songs and poems, echoing the deepest expressions of the human heart. For millennia, these ancient texts have served as a source of solace in times of sorrow, a voice of exultation in moments of joy, and a guide for profound spiritual reflection. What makes this compilation so enduringly relevant? This article explores the authorship, historical context, and rich theological landscape of the Psalms, uncovering the purpose and unique teachings of ancient Israel's hymnal.

## Authorship

The Book of Psalms represents a diverse collection of 150 poems composed by multiple authors over several centuries. Unlike most biblical books with single authors, Psalms functions as ancient Israel's hymnal, compiled from various sources.

**Traditional Attributions:**

The psalm superscriptions (titles) attribute authorship as follows:
- **David**: 73 psalms (nearly half the Psalter)
- **Asaph**: 12 psalms (50, 73-83)
- **Sons of Korah**: 11 psalms (42, 44-49, 84-85, 87-88)
- **Solomon**: 2 psalms (72, 127)
- **Moses**: 1 psalm (90)
- **Ethan the Ezrahite**: 1 psalm (89)
- **Heman the Ezrahite**: 1 psalm (88)
- **Anonymous**: 50 psalms bear no attribution

**Jewish Tradition:**

According to rabbinic tradition, the Book of Psalms was composed by ten authors: the First Man (Adam), Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Heman, Jeduthun, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah. The Talmud credits David with compiling and editing the Psalter, even for psalms he didn't personally write.

**Modern Scholarly Assessment:**

Contemporary biblical scholars express considerable skepticism about the historical accuracy of traditional authorship attributions. The superscriptions may represent later editorial additions linking psalms to well-known figures rather than actual authorship claims. Davidic authorship is not accepted as historical fact by most modern scholars.

However, internal evidence suggests some psalms genuinely originate from the periods and contexts claimed:
- Linguistic analysis dates some psalms to the 10th century BCE (Psalms 29, 104)
- Others clearly reflect post-exilic theology (5th century BCE or later)
- The composition period spans at least five centuries

**Scholarly Resources:**

- [Bible Interpretation (University of Arizona) - When Was the Psalter Compiled?](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/when-was-psalter-compiled)

## Historical Environment

**Dating and Compilation:**

The dating of individual psalms is "notoriously difficult." If the historical descriptions are accurate:
- **Earliest**: Moses wrote Psalm 90 during the wilderness wanderings (approximately 1440-1400 BCE)
- **Middle Period**: Many psalms originated during David's and Solomon's reigns (10th century BCE)
- **Latest**: Post-exilic psalms were completed after the return from Babylon (537 BCE onward)
- **Final Compilation**: A strong scholarly consensus now places the final compilation of the five-book Psalter in the late Persian period (5th–4th centuries BCE). This is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the book of Chronicles, which quotes from a five-book Psalter, and the Septuagint (Greek translation), which attests to a complete Psalter by the 3rd or 2nd century BCE.

While the Dead Sea Scrolls show evidence of some fluidity in the ordering of psalms into the 1st century CE, this is now largely seen as the circulation of alternative liturgical arrangements, rather than evidence that the Psalter itself was still being formed. The basic framework of the 150-psalm collection was already well-established.

**Cultural and Political Context:**

The majority of psalms originated in the southern kingdom of Judah and were intimately connected with Jerusalem's temple worship. The historical contexts represented include:

1. **United Monarchy** (c. 1000-930 BCE): Royal psalms celebrating the Davidic covenant and kingship
2. **Divided Kingdom** (930-586 BCE): Psalms reflecting national crises, wars, and prophetic warnings
3. **Babylonian Exile** (586-539 BCE): Lament psalms expressing grief over Jerusalem's destruction (e.g., Psalm 137)
4. **Post-Exilic Period** (539 BCE onward): Psalms celebrating temple reconstruction and renewed worship

**Literary and Religious Environment:**

Psalms shares characteristics with ancient Near Eastern hymnic literature, particularly:
- **Canaanite influence**: Psalms 29 and 104 reflect Canaanite and Mesopotamian poetic styles
- **Egyptian parallels**: Psalm 104 shows remarkable similarity to the Egyptian "Hymn to Aten"
- **Mesopotamian wisdom**: Certain psalms parallel Babylonian penitential prayers

**Intended Audience:**

The Psalter served the worshiping community of Israel. Most psalms functioned as librettos during temple worship, sung by Levitical choirs accompanied by instruments. The book represents Israel's final, authoritative hymnbook.

## Purpose

The Book of Psalms serves multiple interconnected purposes within Israel's religious life:

**1. Temple Liturgy:**

Psalms functioned primarily as Israel's worship manual for temple liturgy. The setting of most psalms can be traced to Jerusalem's temple, where they were composed, regularly performed, and carefully preserved. During the Second Temple period, Levites sang the "Psalm of the Day" accompanied by instrumental music, with priests drawing three blasts from silver trumpets while worshipers bowed.

**2. Festival Celebrations:**

Specific psalms accompanied the three pilgrim festivals requiring all Jewish males to come to Jerusalem:
- **Passover**: Psalms 113-114 sung before the meal; Psalms 115-118 sung after (the "Hallel" psalms)
- **Pentecost/Weeks**: Harvest thanksgiving psalms
- **Tabernacles/Booths**: Psalms celebrating God's provision

The "Psalms of Ascent" (120-134) were sung by pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem.

**3. Royal Ceremonies:**

Royal psalms (2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 101, 110, 132, 144:1-11) accompanied coronations, royal weddings, military campaigns, and other state occasions, celebrating the Davidic covenant and God's choice of Jerusalem.

**4. Personal and Corporate Prayer:**

Psalms provided language for expressing the full range of human experience before God:
- **Lament**: Individual and communal suffering, persecution, illness
- **Praise**: Thanksgiving for deliverance, harvest, God's attributes
- **Confession**: Acknowledgment of sin and plea for forgiveness
- **Trust**: Confidence in God's protection and faithfulness

**5. Theological Instruction:**

Wisdom psalms (1, 37, 49, 73, 112, 127, 128, 133) teach about righteous living, divine justice, and the Torah's centrality. Torah psalms (1, 19, 119) celebrate God's revealed instruction.

**6. Messianic Prophecy:**

Certain psalms are traditionally understood in Judaism to contain prophecies about the Messiah, the anointed king from the line of David who will redeem Israel and usher in an era of peace. While many psalms are understood by Christians to be messianic, this section focuses on those with a basis in Jewish messianic expectation.

- **Psalm 2:** This psalm speaks of a king whom God calls His son and who will have dominion over the nations. Jewish tradition sees this as a reference to the Messiah's role as the ideal king.
- **Psalm 110:** This is one of the most significant messianic psalms in both Jewish and Christian thought. It speaks of a figure who is both a king and a priest, and who will be victorious over his enemies. The [Midrash on Psalms 18:29](https://jewsforjesus.org/messianic-prophecies/the-messiah-would-be-greater-than-david) explains that the Messiah will be seated at God's right hand, a position of great honor.
- **Psalm 72:** This psalm describes the reign of a righteous and just king who will bring prosperity and peace to his people. This is seen as a portrait of the messianic era.
- **Psalm 89:** This psalm speaks of God's eternal covenant with David and his descendants, which is the foundation of the Jewish belief in a messianic king from the Davidic line.

**7. Shaping Community Identity:**

The Psalter shaped Israel's identity as God's covenant people, rehearsing their salvation history, expressing their unique relationship with Yahweh, and distinguishing them from surrounding nations.

## Canonical Status

The Book of Psalms holds an uncontested place in the biblical canon, positioned as the first book of the Ketuvim (Writings) in the Hebrew Bible. Its 150 psalms are divided into five books, likely mirroring the Torah. While the canonization timeline is debated, the collection was largely stabilized by the 2nd century BCE, as evidenced by its inclusion in the [Septuagint](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint). Its authority is affirmed by Jesus's own words (Luke 24:44), its extensive use in temple and synagogue worship, and its frequent quotation in the New Testament. The [Psalms of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms_of_Solomon), a collection of 18 psalms from the first or second century BC, were not admitted into the biblical canon because they were considered pseudepigrapha, meaning they were falsely attributed to Solomon.

## Summary of the Psalms by Book

The Book of Psalms contains 150 poems spanning Israel's worship, theology, and spiritual life. This summary emphasizes God's direct words, commands, and inspired teachings throughout.

### Book 1 (Psalms 1-41): The Davidic Collection

The Psalter opens with Psalm 1, a wisdom meditation establishing the righteous-wicked contrast: "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked" (Psalm 1:1). This psalm introduces the Torah-centered spirituality pervading the collection: "But whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night" (Psalm 1:2).

Psalm 2, the first royal/messianic psalm, presents **God's decree** concerning His anointed king: "You are my son; today I have become your father" (Psalm 2:7). **God warns** the nations: "Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction" (Psalm 2:12).

David's psalms in this section express profound trust amid persecution. Psalm 8 celebrates human dignity in creation: "You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor" (Psalm 8:5).

Psalm 19 contains **God's inspired testimony** about His revelation: "The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple" (Psalm 19:7).

Psalm 22, quoted by Jesus on the cross, prophetically describes crucifixion: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1). The psalm includes remarkable details: "They pierce my hands and my feet" (Psalm 22:16), "They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment" (Psalm 22:18).

The beloved Psalm 23 declares God's shepherding care: "The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing" (Psalm 23:1). This psalm affirms divine guidance and protection through death itself: "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me" (Psalm 23:4).

### Book 2 (Psalms 42-72): The Korahite and Davidic Collections

Psalm 45 is a royal wedding song with messianic overtones. It addresses the king with a remarkable statement, applying divine titles to him: "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom" (Psalm 45:6).

Psalm 46 celebrates God's presence as refuge: "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble" (Psalm 46:1). **God speaks**: "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth" (Psalm 46:10).

Psalm 51, David's penitential psalm after his sin with Bathsheba, models repentance: "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions" (Psalm 51:1). David acknowledges: "Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight" (Psalm 51:4). He requests: "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me" (Psalm 51:10).

Psalm 72, Solomon's psalm, prays for the righteous king and becomes messianic prophecy: "May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth" (Psalm 72:8). "May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him" (Psalm 72:11).

### Book 3 (Psalms 73-89): The Asaphite Collection

Psalm 73 wrestles with the question of why God permits evil, questioning why the wicked prosper. Asaph confesses that he nearly lost his faith until he entered God's sanctuary. There, he understood the final destiny of the wicked (Psalm 73:17). He concludes: "Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you" (Psalm 73:25).

Psalm 78 rehearses Israel's salvation history as warning and instruction, recounting the exodus, wilderness wanderings, and conquest. **God's inspired teaching** through history emphasizes His mighty acts and Israel's recurring rebellion, establishing patterns of divine faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness.

Psalm 82 presents **God judging** the divine council: "How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?" (Psalm 82:2). **God commands**: "Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed" (Psalm 82:3).

Psalm 89 celebrates the Davidic covenant but ends in lament over its apparent failure, questioning **God's promises**: "You have said, 'I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant, I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations'" (Psalm 89:3-4).

### Book 4 (Psalms 90-106): The Kingship of Yahweh Collection

Psalm 90, attributed to Moses, reflects on human mortality: "Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow" (Psalm 90:10). Moses prays: "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom" (Psalm 90:12).

Psalm 91 promises divine protection: "Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty" (Psalm 91:1). **God speaks directly**: "Because he loves me," says the LORD, "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name" (Psalm 91:14).

Psalms 93-99 form the "Enthronement Psalms," celebrating Yahweh's kingship: "The LORD reigns, let the earth be glad" (Psalm 97:1).

Psalm 100, the beloved worship psalm, calls: "Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs" (Psalm 100:1-2). It affirms: "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture" (Psalm 100:3).

Psalm 103 praises God's compassion: "The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love" (Psalm 103:8). God's forgiveness is celebrated: "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us" (Psalm 103:12).

### Book 5 (Psalms 107-150): The Final Collection

Psalm 110 is the most-quoted Old Testament passage in the New Testament. It presents **the LORD's oracle** to David's Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet" (Psalm 110:1). **The LORD declares** a revolutionary combination of kingship and priesthood: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek" (Psalm 110:4).

Psalm 118, part of the Hallel sung at Passover, proclaims: "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone" (Psalm 118:22). This verse is applied to Jesus in the New Testament.

Psalm 119, the longest chapter in the Bible (176 verses), is an elaborate acrostic poem celebrating God's Torah. Every verse references God's word, law, statutes, precepts, commands, or decrees. Key affirmations include: "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path" (Psalm 119:105). "The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple" (Psalm 119:130).

The "Songs of Ascents," Psalms 120-134, were sung by pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem. Psalm 121 affirms: "I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from? My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth" (Psalm 121:1-2). **God's promise**: "The LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore" (Psalm 121:8).

Psalm 137, written during Babylonian exile, expresses profound grief: "By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion" (Psalm 137:1).

The Psalter concludes with five hallelujah psalms (146-150) of pure praise. Psalm 150 calls all creation to praise: "Praise the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens" (Psalm 150:1). The final verse summarizes: "Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD" (Psalm 150:6).

## Unique Teachings

The Book of Psalms contains several teachings that are not found elsewhere in the Bible, or that are expressed with a unique depth and emphasis.

### Imprecatory Psalms

The imprecatory psalms, or cursing psalms, are unique to the Book of Psalms. These psalms call for God to bring judgment and calamity upon the enemies of the psalmist and God's people. Examples include Psalm 69, 109, and 137. While the concept of divine judgment is common in the Bible, these psalms are unique in their direct and personal appeals for vengeance. They are a raw and honest expression of the human desire for justice in the face of evil.

### Torah Meditation as a Spiritual Discipline

While the importance of God's law is a central theme of the Old Testament, the Book of Psalms, particularly [Psalm 119](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119&version=ESV), elevates the study and meditation of Torah to a form of worship and a central spiritual discipline. The psalm's 176 verses are an extended meditation on the beauty, goodness, and wisdom of God's instruction. This profound emphasis on the personal and devotional study of scripture is a unique contribution of the Psalms.

### The King as God's Son

Psalm 2 contains a unique declaration that the Davidic king is God's son: "You are my son; today I have become your father" (Psalm 2:7). While other Old Testament passages speak of the king as God's chosen servant, this is the only place where the king is explicitly called God's son. This verse became a cornerstone of messianic expectation in both Judaism and Christianity, and it is frequently quoted in the New Testament in reference to Jesus.

## Numbering Differences

The numbering of the Psalms differs between the Hebrew (Masoretic) text and the Greek (Septuagint) text. This is because the Septuagint combines some psalms and divides others. For example, Psalms 9 and 10 in the Hebrew Bible are combined into Psalm 9 in the Septuagint. This numbering difference affects most of the psalms, so it is important to be aware of which numbering system is being used when studying the Psalms.

## Textual Issues

The Book of Psalms, like all ancient texts, contains textual issues that scholars have studied for centuries. These are not necessarily "errors," but rather challenges to our understanding of the original text.

### Hapax Legomena

A **hapax legomenon** is a word that appears only once in a body of text. The Book of Psalms contains a number of these words, which can make translation and interpretation difficult. Since there are no other contexts in which to study the word, scholars must rely on the surrounding text and their knowledge of ancient Hebrew to determine the word's meaning. An example of a hapax legomenon in the Psalms is the word *selah*, which appears 71 times in the Psalms and three times in the book of Habakkuk, but its exact meaning is still unknown.

### Acrostic Gaps and Irregularities

Several of the acrostic psalms, where each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet, contain irregularities. For example, [Psalm 145](https://www.tbsbibles.org/page/psalm145) is missing the letter "nun". While some scholars believe this is a scribal error, others argue that it was intentional. These irregularities are a fascinating feature of the text and a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.

## Apparent Contradictions

The Book of Psalms contains a diversity of voices and perspectives, which can sometimes appear contradictory. However, these are often better understood as different perspectives on the same complex reality, rather than outright contradictions.

### Retribution Theology vs. Lived Experience

Some psalms, like [Psalm 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+1&version=ESV), confidently assert that the righteous prosper while the wicked suffer. Others, like [Psalm 73](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+73&version=ESV), lament the prosperity of the wicked. This is not a contradiction, but a reflection of the tension between the ideal of divine justice and the reality of human experience. The psalms as a whole present a more nuanced view, where the righteous may suffer for a time, but will ultimately be vindicated.

### God's Unchanging Nature vs. God's Responsiveness

Some psalms speak of God's unchanging nature and eternal faithfulness, while others plead with God to "wake up" and act. This is not a contradiction, but a reflection of the psalmist's relationship with a God who is both transcendent and immanent. The psalms portray a God who is both constant and responsive to the prayers of His people.

### Death and the Afterlife

The psalms present a developing understanding of the afterlife. Some psalms, like [Psalm 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+6&version=ESV), speak of Sheol as a place of darkness and silence, where there is no praise of God. Other psalms, like [Psalm 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+16&version=ESV), express a hope of resurrection and eternal life with God. This is not a contradiction, but a reflection of the progressive revelation of God's plan for humanity.

## Credibility of Psalms

The Book of Psalms is a collection of ancient Hebrew poetry that has been a source of inspiration and guidance for Jews and Christians for centuries. However, like all ancient texts, the book of Psalms is not without its textual issues. This section will provide an overview of the credibility of the Psalms, summarizing the textual variations, errors, and contradictions that have been identified by scholars.

### Explainable Issues

Most of the textual issues in the Book of Psalms can be explained as the result of scribal errors, translation issues, or the long and complex history of the text.

* **[Numbering Differences](#numbering-differences):** The numbering of the Psalms differs between the Hebrew and Greek versions of the Old Testament. This is due to the fact that some psalms were combined or divided in the process of translation.
* **[Acrostic Gaps and Irregularities](#acrostic-gaps-and-irregularities):** Several of the acrostic psalms, where each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet, are missing a letter or have other irregularities. These are likely due to scribal errors that occurred during the transmission of the text.
* **[Hapax Legomena](#hapax-legomena):** The Psalms contain a number of words that appear only once in the Bible, which can make translation and interpretation difficult. This is not an error, but a feature of the text that reflects the richness and diversity of the Hebrew language.
* **[Apparent Contradictions](#apparent-contradictions):** The Psalms contain a diversity of voices and perspectives, which can sometimes appear contradictory. However, these are often better understood as different perspectives on the same complex reality, rather than outright contradictions.

### Concerning Issues

There are a few textual issues in the Book of Psalms that are more concerning and have been the subject of much scholarly debate.

* **Psalm 22:16:** In the Hebrew text, this verse reads "like a lion, they are at my hands and feet," while the Septuagint reads "they have pierced my hands and feet." This is a significant difference, as the Septuagint reading is seen by Christians as a prophecy of the crucifixion of Jesus.
* **Psalm 40:6:** The Hebrew text reads "ears you have dug for me," while the Septuagint reads "a body you have prepared for me." This is another significant difference that has been the subject of much debate.

Overall, the Book of Psalms is a credible and reliable collection of ancient Hebrew poetry. While there are some textual issues, these do not affect the overall message and meaning of the book.
