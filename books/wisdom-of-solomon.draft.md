# Wisdom of Solomon

## Authorship

The Wisdom of Solomon, also known as the Book of Wisdom, presents itself as being authored by King Solomon, particularly in chapters 6-9 where the speaker identifies himself using language reminiscent of Solomon's biblical persona. However, this attribution has been recognized as [literary fiction](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/wisdom.html) since ancient times, and virtually no modern scholars—even in conservative circles—accept Solomonic authorship.

### Traditional Attribution vs. Scholarly Consensus

The traditional attribution to Solomon is based on the book's internal claims, where the author writes in Solomon's voice, speaking of himself as a king who sought wisdom (Wisdom 7-9). This literary device, known as pseudepigraphy, was a common practice in ancient Jewish wisdom literature, lending authority and prestige to the work by associating it with Israel's wisest king.

However, [scholarly consensus](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/wisdom.html) firmly rejects Solomonic authorship for several compelling reasons. As J. Alberto Soggin notes, "Practically all scholars, even in conservative circles, agree that the book should not be attributed to Solomon." Even ancient church fathers like Augustine and Jerome acknowledged that the author was pseudonymous.

### Evidence for Greek Composition by an Unknown Author

Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the Wisdom of Solomon was composed in Greek by an unknown Hellenistic Jewish author, rather than being translated from Hebrew or Aramaic:

1. **Greek Literary Style**: The book is written in sophisticated Koine Greek with excellent style and shows none of the characteristics typical of translated Greek. The author demonstrates fluency with Greek rhetorical devices and literary conventions.

2. **Septuagint Quotations**: The author quotes directly from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), which almost necessitates a Greek original rather than a Hebrew text that was later translated.

3. **Greek Philosophical Terminology**: The work extensively employs technical Greek philosophical terminology and concepts from Hellenistic philosophy, particularly Stoic and Platonic thought. The discussion of the immortality of the soul (rather than bodily resurrection) reflects Greek rather than traditional Jewish theology.

4. **Greek Compound Words**: The author shows particular affinity for compound words, a feature common in Alexandrian Greek literature of the period.

5. **Greek Poetic Language**: The text uses Greek words and phrases found primarily in Greek poetry, not in translated Semitic texts.

### Alexandrian Origin

There is broad scholarly agreement that the book was written in [Alexandria, Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wisdom-of-Solomon). Multiple factors point to this conclusion:

- The use of the Greek language and Hellenistic philosophical concepts
- The polemic against Egyptian animal worship (Wisdom 11-15), which would be most relevant to a Jewish audience in Egypt
- The extensive focus on the Exodus narrative, particularly relevant to Egyptian Jews
- The author's use of Egyptian imagery, including descriptions of personified Wisdom that parallel attributes of the Egyptian goddess Isis
- Similarities with the works of Philo of Alexandria, a Jewish philosopher writing in the same time and place

### Date of Composition

Scholars generally date the Wisdom of Solomon to the late first century BCE or early first century CE, with most placing it around 50 BCE, though estimates range from 220 BCE to 100 CE. [David deSilva](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/wisdom.html) suggests "a date within the early period of Roman domination of Egypt" fits best with the text's evidence, particularly noting that the description of ruler cult practices matches "the spontaneous, decentralized development of the imperial cult under Augustus."

The book's Greek composition, Hellenistic philosophical framework, and lack of references to events later than the early Roman period support a dating around the turn of the era—approximately thirty years on either side of 1 CE.

### Unity of Authorship

While some earlier scholars proposed that the book was composed by multiple authors at different times (noting differences in style between chapters 1-5, 6-9, and 10-19), the majority of modern critics defend the unity of authorship. Addison Wright observes that factors favoring composite authorship "are far outweighed by the homogeneity of vocabulary and of outlook throughout" the work. The book demonstrates consistent theological themes, vocabulary, and literary style that point to a single, highly educated Hellenistic Jewish author.

### Summary

The Wisdom of Solomon was composed in Greek by an unknown Hellenistic Jewish author in Alexandria, Egypt, around the turn of the common era (late 1st century BCE to early 1st century CE). Though attributed to Solomon through literary convention, this pseudepigraphic attribution has been recognized since antiquity. The author was likely a well-educated member of the Alexandrian Jewish community, thoroughly versed in both Greek philosophy and Jewish scripture, who wrote to encourage faithfulness and wisdom among Diaspora Jews facing cultural and religious pressures in the Hellenistic world.

## Historical Environment

The Wisdom of Solomon emerged from one of the most significant Jewish communities in the ancient world: [Alexandria, Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Alexandria). Understanding the historical, cultural, and political context of this cosmopolitan city is essential for grasping the book's message and purpose.

### The Alexandrian Jewish Community

[Alexandria](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/alexandria) was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE and quickly became one of the most important cities in the ancient world. The Jewish community in Alexandria was particularly significant, forming as much as one-third of the city's total population in certain periods. Two of the five city districts were designated as Jewish quarters because the majority of their inhabitants were Jews.

The first Ptolemaic rulers (the Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt after Alexander's death) assigned a separate section of the city to Jewish residents, allowing them to observe their laws without constant interference from the pagan population. This semi-autonomous status gave the Jewish community considerable freedom in religious and civic matters.

### Hellenization and Cultural Synthesis

The Jews of Alexandria were among the most Hellenized of all Jewish communities, speaking Greek as their common language and creating a distinctive synthesis of Greek and Jewish culture. During the Ptolemaic period (323-30 BCE), Alexandrian Jews played a central role in the development of Hellenistic Judaism. They were instrumental in producing the [Septuagint](https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1171-alexandria-egypt-ancient), the Greek translation of the Torah completed around 250 BCE, which became the standard Bible for Greek-speaking Jews.

Far from seeing Greek philosophy and Jewish tradition as incompatible, many Alexandrian Jews contended that Greek philosophy had derived its concepts from Jewish sources and that there was no fundamental contradiction between the two systems of thought. This cultural synthesis is evident throughout the Wisdom of Solomon, which seamlessly integrates Platonic and Stoic concepts with traditional Jewish theology.

### Political Status: From Ptolemaic to Roman Rule

During the Ptolemaic period, Alexandria's Jewish population enjoyed relatively favorable conditions. Jews served as secular public officials and soldiers in the Ptolemaic army. According to the geographer Strabo, the Jewish community had substantial autonomy under an ethnarch (ethnic leader) who "governs the people and adjudicates suits and supervises contracts and ordinances just as if he were the head of a sovereign state."

However, the situation changed dramatically after the [Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/egypt-virtual-jewish-history-tour). Augustus Caesar restructured the social hierarchy, placing Jews in the lowest class and forcing them to pay a special poll tax. This was a significant blow to Jewish pride and status. While a few individual Jewish families had received Greek citizenship, the vast majority of Jews could no longer register in the gymnasia (the institution central to Greek civic life and education) and were subjected to degrading taxation.

Following the Roman conquest, intense anti-Semitism became widespread throughout Alexandria's non-Jewish populations. This deteriorating social and political situation likely contributed to the book's composition.

### Dating and Historical Context

Most scholars date the Wisdom of Solomon to the late first century BCE or early first century CE, placing it during the critical transition from Ptolemaic to Roman rule. Some scholars, particularly David Winston, have argued for a more specific dating during the reign of the Roman emperor Gaius Caligula (37-41 CE), when anti-Jewish persecution in Alexandria reached violent levels. However, the majority view favors an earlier date around 50 BCE to 30 CE.

The book contains references that suggest a context of persecution or at least significant social pressure. Passages such as Wisdom 3:1, 5:1, and 6:5-9 imply that the Jewish audience was suffering under persecution, while chapters 11-19 express strong animosity against the Egyptians as a persecuting power.

### Cultural and Religious Pressures

The Jewish community in Alexandria faced multiple challenges that shaped the book's message:

1. **Assimilation and Apostasy**: The attractions of Greek culture, philosophy, and civic life tempted many Jews to abandon their distinctive practices and beliefs.

2. **Idolatry**: Egyptian religion, with its elaborate animal worship and many gods, was omnipresent in Alexandria. The author's extended polemic against idolatry (chapters 13-15) reflects this environment.

3. **Materialism**: Greek philosophical schools like Epicureanism promoted views of life and death that conflicted with Jewish beliefs about divine justice and the afterlife.

4. **Social Discrimination**: Jews faced increasing marginalization and persecution, raising difficult questions about God's justice and the value of maintaining Jewish identity.

5. **Intellectual Challenges**: Greek philosophy and science appeared sophisticated and rational, potentially making traditional Jewish beliefs seem primitive or superstitious to educated Jews.

### Geographic and Social Setting

Alexandria in this period was a major center of learning, home to the famous Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion (a research institution). The city was cosmopolitan and multicultural, with Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, and other ethnic groups living in close proximity. This environment created both opportunities and challenges for the Jewish community—opportunities for cultural and intellectual engagement, but also pressures to assimilate and abandon distinctive Jewish practices.

The author of Wisdom appears to have been a highly educated member of the Jewish community, likely part of the intellectual elite who were thoroughly versed in both Jewish scripture (in its Greek Septuagint form) and Greek philosophy and rhetoric. The book reflects the sophisticated urban environment of Alexandria, where religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions met and competed for adherents.

## Purpose

The Wisdom of Solomon was written with multiple interconnected purposes, all aimed at strengthening Jewish faith and identity in the challenging Hellenistic environment of Alexandria.

### Primary Purposes

#### 1. Combating Apostasy and Encouraging Faithfulness

The book's most fundamental purpose was to prevent Jewish apostasy and encourage faithfulness to the ancestral religion. The author addresses "young Jews in danger of slipping away from their Jewish heritage into pagan materialism" and those "tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world."

The opening chapters (1-5) directly confront the worldview of those who have abandoned Jewish faith, presenting their philosophy in vivid detail (2:1-20) before systematically refuting it. The author seeks to demonstrate that traditional Jewish beliefs about divine justice, immortality, and righteousness are not only true but also philosophically superior to Greek alternatives.

#### 2. Apologetic Defense of Judaism

The book serves an [apologetic function](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wisdom-of-Solomon), defending Judaism against both internal doubts and external criticisms. The author seeks to "preserve Jewish identity and at the same time counteract the anti-Semitic literature of the Gentiles." This apologetic purpose is evident in several ways:

- Demonstrating that Jewish wisdom is compatible with the best of Greek philosophy
- Showing that biblical morality is superior to Hellenistic ethics
- Arguing that monotheism is more rational than polytheism and idolatry
- Defending God's justice in light of the suffering of the righteous

#### 3. Justifying Divine Justice

A central theological purpose is to justify God's actions and vindicate divine justice. The author addresses the troubling question: Why do the wicked prosper while the righteous suffer? This issue was particularly acute for Jews facing persecution and discrimination in Alexandria. The book's answer emphasizes:

- The immortality of the soul and rewards in the afterlife (chapters 1-5)
- God's ultimate judgment of the wicked and vindication of the righteous
- The testing and purification of the faithful through trials (3:5-6)

#### 4. Encouraging Love for Jewish Tradition

Beyond merely preventing apostasy, the author seeks to cultivate positive appreciation for the Jewish tradition. The work aims "to encourage Jewish readers to love their revealed tradition" by demonstrating its wisdom, beauty, and superiority. The extended meditation on the Exodus (chapters 10-19) retells Israel's sacred history in a way that emphasizes God's providential care and the special relationship between God and Israel.

### Secondary Purposes

#### 5. Combating Idolatry

Chapters 13-15 contain an extensive and sophisticated critique of idolatry in all its forms—nature worship, image worship, and emperor worship. This polemic addresses the specific context of Alexandria, where Egyptian animal worship and Greek polytheism were ubiquitous. The author seeks to inoculate Jewish readers against the appeal of pagan religion by exposing its irrationality and immorality.

#### 6. Addressing Greek Philosophy

The author engages seriously with Greek philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism and Platonism. Rather than rejecting Greek philosophy entirely, the author selectively adopts concepts and vocabulary that support Jewish theological claims while rejecting materialist and polytheistic elements. This approach aims to show that Jewish wisdom can engage with Greek thought on equal or superior terms.

#### 7. Providing Theological Education

The book serves a pedagogical purpose, teaching Jewish theology and ethics in sophisticated terms. The author explains difficult theological concepts like divine providence, theodicy, immortality, and wisdom using both biblical and philosophical language. The purpose is "pedagogical and apologetic rather than historical."

#### 8. Displaying Encyclopedic Knowledge

The work demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of Scripture, philosophy, science, and rhetoric—knowledge "capable of impressing sophisticated readers." This display of learning serves to boost Jewish confidence and counter any sense that Greek education and culture were inherently superior to Jewish tradition.

### Genre and Rhetorical Strategy

The book belongs to the genre of [protreptic literature](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wisdom-of-Solomon)—rhetorical exhortation designed to persuade readers to adopt or maintain a particular philosophical or religious way of life. Though the implied audience is "the rulers of the earth" (Wisdom 1:1), the actual audience was educated Jews who needed intellectual and spiritual fortification.

The author employs sophisticated Greek rhetorical techniques while grounding arguments in Jewish Scripture and tradition, creating a synthesis that validates both sources of authority. This strategy allows the author to speak to Jews who have been educated in Greek rhetoric and philosophy without abandoning Jewish theological foundations.

### Multiple Audiences, Multiple Messages

Some scholars suggest the book may have been "directed both to Jews who, responding to their non-Jewish environment, had apostatized and adopted pagan gods and to rigorist Jews who in the same environment advocated complete religious and social isolation." If so, the author steers a middle course—engaging positively with Greek culture and learning while firmly maintaining Jewish identity and theological commitments.

### Summary of Purpose

In summary, the Wisdom of Solomon was written to address the crisis of Jewish identity and faith in the Hellenistic Diaspora. The author seeks to prevent apostasy, defend Judaism intellectually, vindicate God's justice, combat idolatry, and demonstrate that Jewish wisdom is equal or superior to Greek philosophy. By presenting a sophisticated synthesis of Jewish tradition and Hellenistic thought, the author aims to strengthen Jewish commitment while showing that faithfulness to the ancestral religion is intellectually respectable and morally superior in the cosmopolitan world of Alexandria.

## Cross-References

The Wisdom of Solomon occupies a significant position in biblical intertextuality, drawing heavily from Old Testament scripture while exerting considerable influence on New Testament authors. Though not directly quoted in the New Testament, the book contains numerous allusions and parallels that demonstrate its importance in the development of early Christian theology.

### Old Testament Sources and Allusions

The Wisdom of Solomon's primary literary source was the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Wisdom) (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), particularly the Wisdom literature and the Book of Isaiah.

#### Isaiah and the Suffering Servant

The most significant Old Testament influence on the Wisdom of Solomon comes from Isaiah, particularly the Suffering Servant passages. The treatment of the suffering righteous person in Wisdom 2:12-20 is heavily indebted to Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (the fourth Suffering Servant song):

- **Wisdom 2:13** uses "pais" (child, or servant), directly from Isaiah 52:13
- **Wisdom 2:15** states "his very sight is a burden," referencing Isaiah 53:2
- **Wisdom 2:18** parallels Isaiah 42:1
- **Wisdom 2:19** makes reference to Isaiah 53:7

These allusions are not merely verbal echoes but theological adaptations of Isaiah's theology of the suffering righteous servant.

#### Other Old Testament Wisdom Literature

As one of the seven sapiential books in the Septuagint (along with Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job, and Sirach), the Wisdom of Solomon draws on this entire tradition. The book engages with themes from Proverbs regarding personified Wisdom and from Job regarding theodicy and divine justice.

#### The Exodus Narrative

Chapters 10-19 of Wisdom extensively retell and reinterpret the Exodus narrative, drawing from Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in the Septuagint. The author uses this foundational story to demonstrate God's providential care for Israel and judgment on the wicked.

### New Testament Allusions and Influence

Though the Wisdom of Solomon is not explicitly quoted in the New Testament, [most scholars](https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/wisdom.html) believe the book predates and was used by New Testament authors, particularly Paul and the author of Hebrews. The extent of influence is substantial, with allusions appearing in multiple New Testament books.

#### Romans: Extensive Literary Dependency

The [relationship between Romans and Wisdom](https://intertextualbible.substack.com/p/the-use-of-wisdom-of-solomon-in-romans) represents one of the clearest examples of New Testament use of the Wisdom of Solomon. Scholar Jonathan Linebaugh notes that "their themes and vocabulary overlap to a considerable extent, and, most significantly, the argumentative sequence...develops in parallel to Wisdom...a rhetorical progression that is unique to Wisdom and Romans."

**Romans 1:18-32 and Wisdom 13:1-14:31**: Paul's critique of pagan idolatry and its moral consequences closely parallels Wisdom's treatment of the same theme. Both texts:

- Describe how people fail to recognize God through observable creation
- Condemn worship of created things rather than the Creator
- Connect idolatry to moral decay
- Use similar vocabulary and rhetorical patterns

**Romans 1:25** states people "exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image," while **Wisdom 13:1-2, 8-10** describes how people "foolish by nature" worship "fire or wind" and crafted idols. The list of crimes in Romans 1:25-31 appears to be a rearrangement of Wisdom 14:23-28.

**Romans 9:20-21 and Wisdom 15:7**: Paul's use of the potter-and-clay metaphor directly echoes Wisdom. Commentator Ernst Käsemann observes that Paul "seems to borrow from...Wisdom of Solomon 15:7 in verse 21b." Romans 9:21 is effectively a reproduction of Wisdom 15:7, with scholars concluding there is "not merely subtle allusion or echo, but full literary dependency." One scholar states directly: "Paul knew and used Wisdom."

**Romans 9:17-20 and Wisdom 12:10-12**: Both passages employ identical rhetorical questions to assert God's unassailable authority, asking who dares challenge divine judgment.

#### Hebrews: Direct Verbal Parallels

The Letter to the Hebrews contains one of the most striking parallels to Wisdom of Solomon, using a [rare Greek word](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/30103/is-hebrews-13-an-allusion-to-wisdom-of-solomon-725-26) found nowhere else in the New Testament.

**Hebrews 1:3 and Wisdom 7:25-26**: The word ἀπαύγασμα ("effulgence; refulgence; brightness") appears only in these two passages:

- **Wisdom 7:26**: "For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness"
- **Hebrews 1:3**: "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance"

This verbal correspondence, combined with the parallel description of Wisdom/Christ as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of God's nature, demonstrates clear literary influence.

#### Matthew: Suffering and Testing Themes

The Gospel of Matthew contains several allusions to the Wisdom of Solomon:

**Matthew 27:43 and Wisdom 2:12-20**: The mocking of Jesus on the cross closely parallels the mocking of the righteous person in Wisdom. The chief priests say, "He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" This echoes Wisdom 2:18: "For if the righteous man is God's son, he will help him and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries."

**Matthew 12:34-39**: Contains a condensation and paraphrase of Wisdom 1:1-11.

**Matthew 12:42**: Christ references "the Queen of the South who listened to the Wisdom of Solomon," making an indirect connection to the Solomonic tradition.

**Matthew 16:18**: The reference to the "power of death" and "gates of Hades" may allude to Wisdom 16:13.

#### Ephesians: Armor of God Imagery

**Ephesians 6:10-17 and Wisdom 5:17-20**: Paul's famous "armor of God" passage draws on the use of Isaianic material in Wisdom 5:17-20. Paul is closer to the Wisdom passage than to Isaiah in his use of the term "whole armor" and in the inclusion of both the shield and the sword as divine weaponry.

#### Other New Testament Books

While less extensively documented, the Wisdom of Solomon also appears to have influenced:

- **James**: Wisdom themes and ethical teachings
- **2 Peter**: Concepts of divine judgment and righteousness
- **John**: The relationship between wisdom and Torah, personification of divine Wisdom
- **Acts**: Wisdom theology and God's providence in history
- **Revelation**: Divine judgment and vindication of the righteous

### Extent of Influence

Although the book is not directly quoted in the canonical New Testament, an important qualifier must be noted: when considering allusions rather than direct quotations, the list of references to deuterocanonical books like Wisdom "is very long." The influence was substantial and widespread across many New Testament books.

### Early Christian Writers

Beyond the canonical New Testament, early Christian writers made extensive use of the Wisdom of Solomon:

- **1 Clement 27:5** alludes to Wisdom 12:12
- Church Fathers including Augustine, Jerome, and others frequently quoted and referenced the book
- The work was widely accepted and used in early Christian liturgy and theology

### Statistical Significance

While scholars have not produced a definitive count of all allusions, the scholarly consensus is clear: the Wisdom of Solomon exerted significant influence on New Testament authors. The book's sophisticated Hellenistic theology, particularly regarding Christology (personified Wisdom), theodicy, and the afterlife, provided conceptual frameworks that early Christian writers found valuable for articulating their faith.

### Conclusion

The Wisdom of Solomon serves as an important bridge between the Old Testament wisdom tradition and New Testament theology. Drawing extensively from Isaiah and the Jewish wisdom literature, it developed themes of suffering righteousness, divine judgment, and cosmic wisdom that profoundly influenced Paul, the author of Hebrews, and other New Testament writers. Though part of the deuterocanonical literature and not universally accepted in the biblical canon, its theological and literary influence on the formation of Christian doctrine is undeniable.

## Canonical Status

The canonical status of the Wisdom of Solomon has been a subject of significant debate throughout church history, with [different Christian traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books) reaching different conclusions about whether the book should be regarded as Scripture. This debate centers on the distinction between the Palestinian Jewish canon and the broader Alexandrian canon, as well as theological and historical questions about authority and inspiration.

### Jewish Canon: Why the Book Was Excluded

The Wisdom of Solomon is not included in the Jewish canon (the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh) nor in the Masoretic Text, for several specific reasons:

#### 1. Greek Composition

The book was composed in Greek by an Alexandrian Jewish author. For inclusion in the Jewish canon, books had to be written in Hebrew (or in some cases Aramaic). Works composed in Greek were automatically disqualified, regardless of their literary quality or theological value. The language of composition was a non-negotiable criterion for canonicity in the Jewish tradition.

#### 2. Date of Composition

Most scholars date the Wisdom of Solomon to the late first century BCE to early first century CE. This places its composition well after what Jewish tradition considered the cessation of prophecy (approximately 333 BCE after the time of Ezra). Books believed to have been authored after this date were excluded from the canon. To be considered canonical, works had to be older than the 4th century BCE or attributed to an author who had lived before that period.

#### 3. Question of Divine Inspiration

The fundamental question for Jewish canonicity was whether the work was written with divine inspiration or was merely human wisdom. As one ancient discussion framed it: Is this "a work of divine wisdom" or just "the wisdom of Solomon"? The absence of prophetic authority and the book's clear dependence on Greek philosophical categories raised questions about its divine inspiration according to traditional Jewish criteria.

#### 4. Septuagint vs. Masoretic Tradition

While the Wisdom of Solomon was included in the Jewish Greek Septuagint (LXX), which was used by Greek-speaking Jews in the Diaspora, it was not included in the Hebrew Masoretic text, which became the authoritative text for rabbinic Judaism. This distinction between Greek and Hebrew textual traditions became significant for later canonical debates in Christianity.

### Early Christian Reception

The earliest Christian communities inherited diverse views about the book's authority:

#### Widespread Early Use

Early Christian writers made extensive use of the Wisdom of Solomon. The book is alluded to in 1 Clement (late 1st century CE) and the Epistle of Barnabas, indicating its authority and popularity in early Christianity. Church Fathers frequently quoted and referenced the work in theological writings and liturgy.

#### Diverse Opinions Among Church Fathers

Even among the Church Fathers, opinions varied:

- **Athanasius** (4th century) wrote that the Book of Wisdom, along with three other deuterocanonical books, while "not being part of the Canon, were appointed by the Fathers to be read"—suggesting it was useful but not fully canonical.

- **Epiphanius of Salamis** (c. 385 CE) mentioned that the Wisdom of Solomon was of disputed canonicity. Around 360 CE, he rejected all the Apocrypha, saying of Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach: "These indeed are useful books and profitable, but they are not placed in the number of the canonical."

- **Rufinus of Aquileia** (c. 400 CE) categorized the Book of Wisdom as "ecclesiastical" rather than "canonical"—meaning it was suitable for church reading and edification but not for establishing doctrine.

- **Jerome** (c. 347-420 CE), the translator of the Latin Vulgate, initially rejected the Apocrypha, arguing that the church "does not receive them among the canonical scriptures." Jerome gave these books the name "Apocrypha" (meaning "hidden" or "secret"). However, he was eventually overruled by church authority and included them in his translation.

### Official Church Councils: Catholic Position

Despite early diversity of opinion, several [church councils](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/defending-the-deuterocanonicals-996) affirmed the canonicity of the Wisdom of Solomon:

- **Council of Rome** (382 CE) - Listed Wisdom as canonical
- **Synod of Hippo** (393 CE) - Affirmed the deuterocanonical books as Scripture
- **Council of Carthage** (397 and 419 CE) - Listed the deuterocanonical books alongside the other 66 books as Scripture
- **Quinisext Council** (692 CE) - Confirmed canonical status
- **Council of Florence** (1442 CE) - Reaffirmed the canon including deuterocanonical books
- **Council of Trent** (1546 CE) - Made an official declaration that the deuterocanonical books, including Wisdom, were to be regarded as Scripture on par with other canonical books

The Catholic Church's position, definitively established at Trent, is that the Wisdom of Solomon is fully canonical Scripture, inspired by God and authoritative for faith and practice.

### Protestant Reformation: The Debate Renewed

The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century reopened the canonical question:

#### Reasons for Protestant Rejection

The Reformers, led by Martin Luther, rejected the deuterocanonical books (which they called the Apocrypha) for several reasons:

1. **Following Jerome and Jewish Canon**: The Reformers noted Jerome's hesitations and observed that these books were not in the Hebrew canon accepted by Jesus and the apostles.

2. **Doctrinal Concerns**: The Apocrypha was used as the basis for several Catholic doctrines that Protestants rejected, particularly purgatory and prayers for the dead. By denying canonical status to these books, Protestants removed what they saw as unbiblical doctrinal foundations.

3. **Lower View of Authority**: Luther and other Reformers considered these books useful for reading and edification but not authoritative for establishing Christian doctrine.

#### Protestant Position

Luther placed these books in a separate section of his German Bible (1534), calling them the Apocrypha and stating they were "books which are not held equal to the sacred Scriptures and yet are useful and good for reading." Most Protestant traditions follow this position, considering the books edifying but not canonical.

The [Protestant position](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-apocrypha/) generally holds that while the Wisdom of Solomon and other deuterocanonical books have historical and spiritual value, they should not be used as the primary basis for Christian doctrine and are not divinely inspired Scripture in the same sense as the 66 books of the Protestant canon.

### Eastern Orthodox Position

The [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://ancientinsights.wordpress.com/2021/05/18/orthodoxy-on-the-deuterocanon/) accepts the deuterocanonical books as fully canonical. The Synod of Jerusalem (1672 CE) received as its canon the books found in the Septuagint, declaring "The Wisdom of Solomon" among others as "genuine parts of Scripture."

The Orthodox canon includes the deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church plus 1 Esdras, 3 Maccabees, Psalm 151, and the Prayer of Manasseh. Orthodox tradition views these books as part of the inspired Scripture received from the early church.

### Current Status Across Traditions

**Catholic Church**: Fully canonical, part of the Old Testament, divinely inspired

**Eastern Orthodox Churches**: Fully canonical, part of the Old Testament, divinely inspired

**Oriental Orthodox Churches**: Fully canonical

**Church of the East**: Canonical status varies by jurisdiction

**Protestant Churches**: Apocryphal—useful for reading but not canonical, not the basis for doctrine

**Modern Rabbinic Judaism**: Not canonical, not part of the Tanakh

### Evidence-Based Considerations

Rather than appealing solely to ecclesial authority, examining the evidence reveals several relevant considerations:

#### Arguments for Canonical Inclusion

1. **Widespread Early Christian Use**: The book was extensively used, quoted, and valued by early Christians, including New Testament authors.

2. **Theological Depth**: The book contains profound theological insights about wisdom, righteousness, divine justice, and the nature of God.

3. **Historical Testimony**: Multiple early church councils affirmed its canonical status before the Reformation controversy.

4. **Septuagint Tradition**: The book was part of the Septuagint, which was the Bible of the early church and is quoted extensively in the New Testament.

#### Arguments Against Canonical Inclusion

1. **Greek Composition**: The book was not written in Hebrew, which was the language of the Palestinian Jewish canon.

2. **Late Date**: Composed after the traditional close of the Hebrew canon and the cessation of prophecy.

3. **Not in Jewish Canon**: Never accepted by the Jewish community as canonical Scripture, despite being written by a Jew.

4. **Church Fathers' Doubts**: Significant early church figures, including Jerome, questioned or denied its canonical status.

5. **Pseudepigraphic**: The book's attribution to Solomon is a literary fiction, not a historical claim, which raises questions about authorial authority.

6. **Doctrinal Distinctives**: Contains theological concepts (immortality of the soul, intermediate state) that differ from typical Hebrew Bible theology, reflecting Greek philosophical influence.

### Conclusion

The canonical status of the Wisdom of Solomon remains divided along traditional ecclesiastical lines. [Catholic and Orthodox traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Wisdom) affirm it as fully inspired Scripture based on early church reception and conciliar authority. Protestant traditions value it as edifying literature but deny its canonical status based on its absence from the Hebrew canon, late date, Greek composition, and concerns about doctrinal use. Modern Judaism does not include it in the Tanakh. The evidence suggests the book had significant authority and influence in early Christianity, even if its formal canonical status remained disputed until resolved differently by different Christian bodies.

## Summary

The Wisdom of Solomon is a 19-chapter work of deuterocanonical literature that blends Jewish theology with Hellenistic philosophy to address fundamental questions about wisdom, righteousness, divine justice, and immortality. The book can be divided into three major sections, each with distinct themes and purposes, though unified by the central motif of wisdom's role in human life and divine providence.

### Part I: The Destiny of the Righteous and the Wicked (Chapters 1-6)

The opening section addresses the rulers of the earth (Wisdom 1:1), calling them to "love righteousness" and "seek the Lord with sincerity of heart." The author warns that "God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living" (Wisdom 1:13), establishing a theology where death entered the world "through the devil's envy" (Wisdom 2:24), but "God created man for incorruption and made him in the image of his own eternity" (Wisdom 2:23).

Chapter 2 presents a vivid portrait of the wicked and their philosophy. Speaking as materialists and hedonists, they declare: "Short and sorrowful is our life, and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end" (Wisdom 2:1). They conclude, "Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use of the creation with youthful zest" (Wisdom 2:6). Their worldview leads to oppression: "Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of the aged" (Wisdom 2:10).

Most significantly, they plot against the righteous person who "professes to have knowledge of God" and "calls himself a child of the Lord" (Wisdom 2:13). They say, "Let us test him with insult and torture, that we may find out how gentle he is, and make trial of his forbearance. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected" (Wisdom 2:19-20). This passage, heavily influenced by Isaiah's Suffering Servant, profoundly influenced New Testament passion narratives.

Chapters 3-5 respond to the wicked's philosophy with divine truth about the righteous and the wicked. The author proclaims: "But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be an affliction, and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace" (Wisdom 3:1-3).

The text continues with the divine promise: "For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself" (Wisdom 3:4-5). This teaching on immortality represents a significant theological development, emphasizing the soul's eternal existence rather than bodily resurrection.

Chapter 5 dramatically portrays the final judgment, where the wicked, seeing the vindication of the righteous, confess their error: "This is the man whom we once held in derision and made a byword of reproach—we fools! We thought that his life was madness and that his end was without honor. Why has he been numbered among the sons of God? And why is his lot among the saints?" (Wisdom 5:4-5). They realize their wealth and pride were worthless: "All those things have vanished like a shadow" (Wisdom 5:9).

God's response to this judgment is described: "Then the righteous man will stand with great confidence in the presence of those who have afflicted him" (Wisdom 5:1), and "The Lord will take his zeal as his whole armor, and will arm creation to repel his enemies" (Wisdom 5:17). The section concludes with the call to rulers: "Therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling" (Wisdom 6:1-2, echoing Psalm 2).

### Part II: Solomon's Praise of Wisdom (Chapters 6-9)

The middle section shifts to personified Wisdom, with Solomon speaking in the first person. Chapter 6 begins the encomium (praise) of Wisdom: "Wisdom is radiant and unfading, and she is easily discerned by those who love her, and is found by those who seek her. She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her" (Wisdom 6:12-13). The intimate relationship with Wisdom is emphasized: "The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction...and love of her is the keeping of her laws" (Wisdom 6:17-18).

Chapter 7 contains Solomon's personal testimony about seeking wisdom. He describes his common humanity: "I also am mortal, like everyone else, a descendant of the first-formed child of earth; and in the womb of a mother I was molded into flesh" (Wisdom 7:1). He prayed for wisdom above all else: "Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given me; I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me. I preferred her to scepters and thrones, and I accounted wealth as nothing in comparison with her" (Wisdom 7:7-8). He values wisdom above health, beauty, and even light itself (Wisdom 7:10).

The famous description of Wisdom's divine attributes follows in Wisdom 7:22-26, listing twenty-one qualities: "For in her there is a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, irresistible, beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent, pure, and most subtle" (Wisdom 7:22-23).

The text then describes Wisdom's divine nature in language that profoundly influenced Christian Christology: "For she is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness" (Wisdom 7:25-26). This passage is echoed in Hebrews 1:3's description of Christ.

Wisdom's cosmic role is emphasized: "Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets" (Wisdom 7:27).

Chapter 8 continues Solomon's love for Wisdom, describing her as his bride: "I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief" (Wisdom 8:9). He recognizes that "no one can gain possession of wisdom except by the gift of God" (Wisdom 8:21, author's paraphrase).

Chapter 9 contains Solomon's prayer for wisdom, a beautiful petition that became influential in later liturgical traditions. He prays: "O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things by thy word, and by thy wisdom hast formed man...give me the wisdom that sits by thy throne, and do not reject me from among thy servants" (Wisdom 9:1-4). He acknowledges human frailty: "For a perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind" (Wisdom 9:15). The prayer concludes: "Who has learned thy counsel, unless thou hast given wisdom and sent thy holy Spirit from on high? And thus the paths of those on earth were set right, and men were taught what pleases thee, and were saved by wisdom" (Wisdom 9:17-18).

### Part III: Wisdom's Work in History (Chapters 10-19)

The final and longest section demonstrates wisdom's guidance throughout Israel's history, structured as a theological meditation on the Exodus. Chapter 10 begins with creation and the patriarchs, though notably without naming anyone specifically. "Wisdom protected the first-formed father of the world, when he alone had been created; she delivered him from his transgression" (Wisdom 10:1, referring to Adam). The chapter recounts how wisdom saved Noah (Wisdom 10:4), guided Abraham (Wisdom 10:5), rescued Lot (Wisdom 10:6), and aided Jacob (Wisdom 10:10), Joseph (Wisdom 10:13-14), and Moses (Wisdom 10:15-16).

The text emphasizes God's direct intervention: "A holy people and blameless race wisdom delivered from a nation of oppressors. She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood dread kings with wonders and signs" (Wisdom 10:15-16, referring to Moses). The crossing of the Red Sea is celebrated: "She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters; but she drowned their enemies, and cast them up from the depth of the abyss" (Wisdom 10:18-19).

Chapters 11-19 present an elaborate series of seven contrasts between God's treatment of Israel and Egypt, demonstrating the principle of "measure for measure" justice. The author explains God's pedagogical purpose: "For thou didst test them as a father does in warning, but thou didst examine the ungodly as a stern king does in condemnation" (Wisdom 11:10).

A key theological statement about God's mercy appears: "But thou art merciful to all, for thou canst do all things, and thou dost overlook men's sins, that they may repent. For thou lovest all things that exist, and hast loathing for none of the things which thou hast made...Thou sparest all things, for they are thine, O Lord who lovest the living" (Wisdom 11:23-26). This universal divine love is balanced with justice: God is patient with sinners "in order that they may give up their wickedness and believe in thee, O Lord" (Wisdom 12:2).

The contrast between Egypt's treatment and Israel's protection is repeatedly emphasized. The Nile's water turned to blood punished Egypt for casting Hebrew infants into the river, while Israel received water from the rock (Wisdom 11:4-7). The plague of frogs afflicted Egypt, while quail fed Israel (Wisdom 11:15-16; 16:2-3). Poisonous creatures tormented Egypt, while a bronze serpent healed Israel (Wisdom 16:5-14). The author declares: "For thy sons, whom thou didst love, O Lord, thou didst teach that it is not the production of crops by which man will live, but that thy word preserves those who trust in thee" (Wisdom 16:26).

Chapters 13-15 contain an extended polemic against idolatry, interrupting the Exodus meditation. The critique begins with nature worship: "For all men who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature; and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know him who exists" (Wisdom 13:1). The author shows some sympathy: "Yet these men are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him" (Wisdom 13:6).

The critique intensifies with manufactured idols. A woodworker makes useful items, then fashions an idol from scraps: "The good-for-nothing wood...a skilled craftsman...makes it in the likeness of man, or makes it like some worthless animal" (Wisdom 13:13-14). The absurdity is emphasized: "He prays about possessions and his marriage and children to a thing that has no strength" (Wisdom 13:18).

Chapter 14 traces the origin of idolatry to various sources, including the grief of a father who made an image of his dead child (Wisdom 14:15) and the flattery of distant rulers (Wisdom 14:17). The moral consequences are severe: "For the worship of idols not to be named is the beginning and cause and end of every evil" (Wisdom 14:27). A catalog of vices follows: "sexual immorality, adultery, licentiousness, foul murder, theft, deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury, confusion over what is good, forgetfulness of favors, pollution of souls, sex perversion, disorder in marriage, adultery, and debauchery" (Wisdom 14:25-26).

The polemic culminates in chapter 15 with ridicule of Egyptian animal worship: "The enemies of thy people worshiped even the most hateful animals, which are worse than all others" (Wisdom 15:18). The potter who makes clay idols is mocked: "His heart is ashes, his hope is cheaper than dirt, and his life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him" (Wisdom 15:10-11).

Chapters 16-19 return to the Exodus contrasts. The plague of darkness, one of the most terrifying, receives extended treatment: "For great darkness was spread over them...But for thy holy ones there was very great light" (Wisdom 17:2, 5). The psychological horror is emphasized: "Whether he was a farmer or a shepherd or a workman toiling in the wilderness, he was seized, and endured the inescapable fate; for with one chain of darkness they all were bound" (Wisdom 17:17).

The tenth plague, the death of the firstborn, forms the climax. Egypt's firstborn died, but Israel was protected: "When peaceful silence lay over all, and night had run half of her swift course, thy all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne, into the midst of the land that was doomed, a stern warrior carrying the sharp sword of thy authentic command, and stood and filled all things with death, and touched heaven while standing on the earth" (Wisdom 18:14-16). This dramatic personification of God's word influenced later Jewish and Christian theology.

Aaron's intercession stopped the plague among Israel: "For the destroyer was not subdued by strength or by force of arms, but by the word he subdued the wrathful avenger, appealing to the oaths sworn to the patriarchs and covenants given to the fathers" (Wisdom 18:22, referring to Aaron's priestly intercession).

The book concludes with the Red Sea deliverance and a reflection on God's miraculous reordering of creation: "For the elements changed places with one another, as on a harp the notes vary the nature of the rhythm, while each note remains the same" (Wisdom 19:18). The final verse summarizes: "For in everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people; and thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places" (Wisdom 19:22).

### Theological Themes

Throughout its nineteen chapters, the Wisdom of Solomon emphasizes several key theological themes: the immortality of the soul, divine justice that vindicates the righteous, the personification of Wisdom as God's agent in creation and history, God's mercy balanced with judgment, the folly and immorality of idolatry, and God's special providence for Israel. The book represents a sophisticated synthesis of Jewish theology and Greek philosophy, addressing the intellectual and spiritual needs of Hellenistic Jews while profoundly influencing early Christian thought about Christ, salvation, and the afterlife.

## Unique Teachings

The Wisdom of Solomon contains several theological and philosophical teachings that are either unique to this book or represent significant developments beyond other biblical texts. Many of these distinctive teachings reflect the book's synthesis of Jewish tradition with Hellenistic philosophy, particularly Platonism and Stoicism.

### 1. Immortality of the Soul (Rather Than Bodily Resurrection)

The Wisdom of Solomon presents ["the first clear statement of immortality"](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon) in Jewish wisdom literature, but with a distinctly Greek philosophical flavor. Unlike traditional Hebrew Bible teaching that emphasizes bodily resurrection (as in Daniel 12:2), Wisdom teaches the immortality of the soul as separate from the body.

The book declares: "But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them" (Wisdom 3:1), and "The souls of the righteous...are at peace...their hope is full of immortality" (Wisdom 3:2-4). This concept is borrowed partly from the Jewish tradition of covenantal retribution and partly from the Greek philosophical idea of the inherently immortal soul.

The teaching represents a significant departure from earlier Jewish thought. As one scholar notes, the author's view "is unique, borrowed partly from the Jewish tradition of covenantal retribution and partly from the Greek idea of the immortal soul (as separate from the body)." The book emphasizes that "righteousness leads to immortality while unrighteousness leads to death," framing eternal life in terms of moral character rather than covenant faithfulness alone.

### 2. Preexistence of Souls

A highly controversial teaching appears in Wisdom 8:19-20, where Solomon states: "As a child I was naturally gifted, and a good soul fell to my lot; or rather, being good, I entered an undefiled body." This passage suggests [the preexistence of the soul](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/478734) before birth, a concept found in Platonic philosophy but foreign to mainstream Jewish theology.

Some scholars interpret this as indicating that souls exist before entering bodies, with moral qualities already established. The phrase "being good, I entered an undefiled body" implies the soul's existence and character precede bodily life. This view "is similar to the view of the sages that the soul preexisted."

However, interpretation is debated. Some scholars argue this may simply mean the soul was created immediately before entering the body, not that it existed eternally. Regardless, the passage represents a philosophical sophistication about the soul-body relationship unique in the biblical canon.

### 3. Neo-Platonic View of the Body as Burden

Closely related to the previous teaching is the book's negative view of the physical body, expressed in Wisdom 9:15: "A perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind." This dualistic view of body and soul reflects Platonic philosophy rather than Hebrew anthropology.

As scholar Bruce Metzger observes: "As for man, his body is regarded as a mere weight and clog to the soul (9:15), a view which is [foreign to both Old Testament and New alike](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon)." The Old Testament typically views the body and soul as an integrated unity, not as antagonistic components. The New Testament also affirms the goodness of embodied existence, teaching bodily resurrection rather than escape from the body.

This teaching influenced later Gnostic and ascetic movements within Christianity that viewed the material world and physical body as inherently inferior or evil.

### 4. Creation from Preexistent, Formless Matter

Wisdom 11:17 contains a unique cosmological claim: "Your all-powerful hand, which created the world out of formless matter." This statement suggests that God fashioned the universe from preexistent, uncreated matter rather than creating ex nihilo (from nothing).

The Greek phrase used here is ["the very phrase which Platonists used to describe the pre-existent matter"](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon) out of which the world was made, implying that this unformed matter was itself uncreated. This concept aligns with Platonic cosmology, where a divine Demiurge shapes preexisting chaotic matter into ordered cosmos.

This teaching contradicts the traditional Jewish and Christian doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, which holds that God created all things from nothing by divine fiat (Genesis 1:1; John 1:3; Hebrews 11:3). The distinction is theologically significant: if matter is uncreated and coeternal with God, it potentially limits God's absolute sovereignty and omnipotence.

### 5. Wisdom as Divine Hypostasis or Personified Attribute

The Wisdom of Solomon develops the personification of Wisdom beyond any other biblical text. [Wisdom is depicted as a feminine personification](https://www.academia.edu/36399093/Sophia_and_Logos_in_the_Book_of_Wisdom_Wisdom_of_Solomon_) of an attribute of God, described as "a breath of the power of God, and a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty" (Wisdom 7:25).

The question debated by scholars is whether Wisdom represents:
- A mere personified attribute (literary device)
- A hypostasis (distinct personal manifestation of God)
- An independent divine being (potentially a goddess in her own right)

The text ascribes to Wisdom attributes and functions that approach independent personality: "Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets" (Wisdom 7:27). Wisdom has agency, will, and the capacity for relationship.

One specific indication of Egyptian origin is the author's use of [Egyptian imagery of the goddess Isis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wisdom-of-Solomon) to describe personified Wisdom as a divine female figure. The attributes ascribed to Wisdom in chapters 7-8 parallel attributes of Isis in Hellenistic Egyptian texts.

This development profoundly influenced Christian theology. Philo of Alexandria "translated the Hebrew concept of divine Wisdom into the masculine idea of Logos (Word)," and "from this concept was developed the Logos theology of the Christian Church Fathers to explain Jesus Christ's relationship to God." The description of Wisdom in Wisdom 7:25-26 is directly paralleled in the description of Christ in Hebrews 1:3.

### 6. Measure-for-Measure Retributive Justice

The Wisdom of Solomon systematically teaches the principle of ["middah keneged middah"](https://www.thetorah.com/article/punishing-the-egypt-measure-for-measure) (measure for measure), declaring "Wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished." Chapters 11-19 interpret the plagues as precise measure-for-measure punishment of the Egyptians for their wicked behaviors.

Specific examples include:
- **Water to blood**: The Nile was changed to blood because the Egyptians sinned with water when they cast Hebrew children into the river (Wisdom 11:6-7)
- **Frogs/quail**: Egypt was punished with creatures from water for drowning babies; Israel was blessed with quail from the sea (Wisdom 11:15-16; 16:2-3)
- **Poisonous creatures**: Egypt suffered from venomous animals for worshiping animal idols; Israel was healed by the bronze serpent (Wisdom 16:5-14)
- **Darkness**: Egypt experienced plague of darkness for imprisoning Israelites who would bear the light of the Law (Wisdom 17:2-18:4)

The guiding principle is stated in Wisdom 11:5: "For through the very things by which their enemies were punished, they themselves received benefit in their need." God uses the very same elements to bless the righteous that He uses to punish the ungodly.

This systematic theological interpretation of the plagues is unique in biblical literature. While the principle of appropriate retribution appears elsewhere in Scripture, the Wisdom of Solomon develops it into a comprehensive hermeneutical framework for understanding divine justice in history.

### 7. Universal Divine Love and Patience

While not entirely unique, the Wisdom of Solomon presents an unusually strong statement of God's universal love for all creation: "For thou lovest all things that exist, and hast loathing for none of the things which thou hast made, for thou wouldst not have made anything if thou hadst hated it. How would anything have endured if thou hadst not willed it? Or how would anything not called forth by thee have been preserved? Thou sparest all things, for they are thine, O Lord who lovest the living" (Wisdom 11:24-26).

This teaching emphasizes God's love for all created beings, not merely Israel. The author explains that God's patience with sinners stems from this universal love: "But thou art merciful to all, for thou canst do all things, and thou dost overlook men's sins, that they may repent" (Wisdom 11:23). God's purpose is redemptive, not merely punitive: He is patient with sinners "in order that they may give up their wickedness and believe in thee, O Lord" (Wisdom 12:2).

This universalist emphasis balances the book's particularist celebration of Israel's election, presenting a theological tension that would later influence Christian universalism.

### 8. Critique of Idolatry Based on Natural Theology

Chapters 13-15 present a sophisticated philosophical critique of idolatry that anticipates Romans 1:18-23. The argument begins with natural theology: "For all men who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature; and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know him who exists" (Wisdom 13:1).

The author shows measured sympathy for nature worshipers: "Yet these men are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him. For as they live among his works they keep searching, and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful" (Wisdom 13:6-7). However, the verdict remains: "Yet again, not even they are to be excused" (Wisdom 13:8).

The critique intensifies with manufactured idols, combining philosophical argumentation, satire, and moral condemnation. The author traces idolatry's origins to grief (Wisdom 14:15), political flattery (Wisdom 14:17), and artistic vanity (Wisdom 13:11-19), then catalogs its moral consequences: "sexual immorality, adultery, licentiousness, foul murder, theft, deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury" (Wisdom 14:25-26).

This rational, philosophical approach to critiquing idolatry—emphasizing natural revelation and the irrationality of idol worship—is unique in the biblical canon and profoundly influenced Paul's argument in Romans.

### Significance

These unique teachings demonstrate the Wisdom of Solomon's role as a bridge between Jewish and Hellenistic thought. While rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition, the book incorporates Greek philosophical concepts in ways that distinguish it from both the Hebrew Bible and most of the New Testament. This synthesis made the book both valuable for Hellenistic Jews navigating between cultures and controversial in later canonical debates. The teachings on immortality, wisdom Christology, and natural theology profoundly influenced early Christian theology, even as the teachings on preexistence, uncreated matter, and body-soul dualism raised concerns about departures from orthodox biblical theology.

## Textual Variants

Unlike canonical books of the Hebrew Bible, the Wisdom of Solomon has a relatively straightforward textual transmission history because it was originally composed in Greek rather than Hebrew. This eliminates the complex issues that arise from comparing Hebrew Masoretic texts with Greek Septuagint translations. Nevertheless, several textual-critical issues merit discussion.

### Original Language and Transmission

The [Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek](https://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/29-wissal-nets.pdf), and the hypothesis that the first half of the book was translated from a Hebrew original has been thoroughly refuted by scholars. The sophisticated Greek style, use of Greek rhetorical devices, compound words characteristic of Alexandrian Greek, and direct quotations from the Septuagint all confirm original Greek composition.

The textual tradition consists primarily of:
1. Greek Septuagint manuscripts
2. Old Latin translations
3. The Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible)
4. Various other ancient versions

### Critical Editions

Two main critical editions of the Greek text exist:

**Rahlfs' Manual Edition** (1935): Alfred Rahlfs' Septuaginta edition relies primarily on three major manuscripts (Codex Alexandrinus [A], Codex Sinaiticus [S], and Codex Vaticanus [B]). This edition served as the basis for the NRSV translation of Wisdom of Solomon. However, [Rahlfs' edition is not a true critical text](https://www.tyndalebulletin.org/article/27734-the-critical-edition-of-the-greek-ot-and-nt-stability-change-and-implications.pdf) but rather a convenient manual edition, and scholars consider it inadequate for serious Septuagint research.

**Ziegler's Göttingen Edition** (editio maior): Joseph Ziegler's critical edition in the Göttingen Septuagint series represents the scholarly standard. As an editio maior, each page contains relatively few lines of biblical text with extensive critical apparatus documenting variant readings. Ziegler's text is based on thorough examination of all available manuscript and translation evidence, making it far superior to Rahlfs' edition.

### Significant Textual Variants

The textual tradition of Wisdom of Solomon is relatively stable, with most variants being minor. However, several noteworthy differences exist:

#### Wisdom 2:9

Ziegler adopted a reading based on Old Latin evidence. The Old Latin reads "pratum" (meadow) in this verse, representing a different Greek Vorlage (source text) than what appears in some Greek manuscripts. This affects the imagery in the wicked's description of their hedonistic philosophy: "Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither" (Wisdom 2:8).

#### Wisdom 18:23

Another instance where Ziegler adopted an Old Latin reading. The Old Latin reads "impetum" versus the Greek "orgēn" (anger/wrath), affecting the description of how Aaron's priestly intercession stopped God's judgment: "he conquered the avenger, not with strength of body, not with force of arms, but with a word he subdued the one who was punishing" (Wisdom 18:22).

### Vulgate and Old Latin

When Jerome produced the Vulgate in the late 4th/early 5th century, he [did not revise Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus](http://goodsamcorvallis.org/wp-content/uploads/Wisdom_of_Solomon_Backgrounder01.pdf). Instead, Wisdom is found in Vulgate manuscripts with texts derived from the Old Latin version. The Old Latin is a literal rendering from the Greek, showing slight variations from later Vulgate standardization.

The Vulgate text of Wisdom is essentially identical with the Old Latin, though with minor variations. This continuity suggests the Latin textual tradition was relatively stable and consistent.

### Manuscript Evidence

The major uncial manuscripts containing Wisdom of Solomon include:
- **Codex Vaticanus** (B, 4th century)
- **Codex Sinaiticus** (S/א, 4th century)
- **Codex Alexandrinus** (A, 5th century)

Beyond these major codices, a [Byzantine manuscript](https://www.peterlang.com/document/1267466) (Codex 199, from the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre in Constantinople) contains the full text of Wisdom with interesting variations from all extant Septuagint codices.

Additionally, [fragments from Khirbet Mird](https://www.academia.edu/37560682/Fragments_of_the_Wisdom_of_Solomon_10_8b_d_and_10_15b_17d_from_Khirbet_Mird_P_Leuven_PAM_21_Rahlfs_888_) (P.Leuven PAM 21 = Rahlfs 888) contain Wisdom of Solomon 10:8b-d and 10:15b-17d, providing additional textual witnesses from the Byzantine period.

### Scholarly Debates

While textual variants exist, [most differences are relatively minor](http://goodsamcorvallis.org/wp-content/uploads/Wisdom_of_Solomon_Backgrounder01.pdf) and do not substantially affect the meaning or theology of the book. The greatest debates concern not textual variants per se, but questions of:
- Composite authorship (whether different sections were written by different authors)
- Possible interpolations
- Literary structure and unity

Some earlier critics treated certain passages as later Christian interpolations, including Wisdom 2:24, 3:13, 4:1, and 14:7. However, closer examination reveals these passages yield meanings perfectly consistent with the author's Jewish theological framework, and scholarly consensus no longer supports interpolation theories.

### Conclusion

The Wisdom of Solomon enjoys a relatively stable textual tradition compared to many biblical books. The original Greek composition eliminates translation issues, and manuscript evidence from the 4th century onward shows remarkable consistency. While Ziegler's critical edition represents advances over Rahlfs' manual edition and incorporates evidence from Old Latin witnesses, the variants are generally minor and do not create significant interpretive difficulties. The book's textual history is therefore far less complex than books like Jeremiah or Daniel, which exist in substantially different Hebrew and Greek versions.

## Textual Errors

The term "textual errors" requires clarification. For books that exist in both Hebrew and Greek versions (like most of the Old Testament), textual errors typically refer to scribal mistakes, translation issues, or discrepancies between textual traditions. However, since the Wisdom of Solomon was originally composed in Greek and has no Hebrew original, "errors" in this section refers primarily to historical, chronological, and theological problems identified by critical scholars.

### 1. Pseudepigraphic Authorship

The most fundamental "error," from one perspective, is the book's implied Solomonic authorship. The text presents itself as [written by Solomon](https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14951-wisdom-of-solomon-book-of-the), particularly in chapters 6-9 where the speaker identifies as a king who sought wisdom above all else. However, Solomon lived in the 10th century BCE, while the book was composed approximately 800-900 years later in the 1st century BCE or early 1st century CE.

**Evidence against Solomonic authorship:**
- Composed in sophisticated Koine Greek, not Hebrew
- Quotes from the Septuagint (Greek translation completed around 250 BCE)
- Shows dependence on Isaiah and other later texts
- Reflects Hellenistic philosophical concepts unknown in Solomon's time
- Uses Greek rhetorical devices and Alexandrian literary style

**Scholarly explanation:** The pseudepigraphic attribution was a [recognized literary fiction](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15666a.htm) even in ancient times. Church Fathers like Augustine and Jerome acknowledged the author was not actually Solomon. The device lent authority to the work by associating it with Israel's wisest king, a common practice in ancient wisdom literature.

**Conservative response:** The book never explicitly claims "Solomon wrote this," but rather adopts Solomon's voice as a literary persona. This rhetorical technique was understood by ancient readers and should not be considered deceptive or erroneous.

### 2. Creation from Preexistent Matter (Wisdom 11:17)

The text states: "Your all-powerful hand, which created the world out of formless matter" (Wisdom 11:17). This appears to [contradict the biblical doctrine of creatio ex nihilo](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon) (creation from nothing).

**The problem:** The Greek phrase employed is identical to terminology Platonists used to describe preexistent, uncreated matter (hyle) from which the Demiurge fashioned the cosmos. This suggests God shaped the universe from eternally existing matter rather than creating all things from nothing.

**Biblical contradiction:** Genesis 1:1 ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"), John 1:3 ("All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being"), and Hebrews 11:3 ("By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible") all support creation from nothing.

**Theological significance:** If matter is uncreated and coeternal with God, this potentially limits divine sovereignty and omnipotence, raising questions about God's absolute supremacy.

**Possible explanations:**
- The author may have used Platonic terminology loosely without intending the full philosophical implications
- "Formless matter" might refer to the "formless void" of Genesis 1:2, with creation from nothing assumed in the prior act
- The author's Hellenistic philosophical framework may have led to genuine theological error on this point
- Later Christian theology clarified this point, and Church Fathers generally interpreted the passage in light of creatio ex nihilo

### 3. Preexistence of Souls (Wisdom 8:19-20)

Solomon's statement, "As a child I was naturally gifted, and a good soul fell to my lot; or rather, being good, I entered an undefiled body" (Wisdom 8:19-20), suggests [souls exist before entering bodies](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/478734).

**The problem:** This reflects Platonic philosophy of soul preexistence, which contradicts mainstream biblical anthropology. The phrase "being good, I entered an undefiled body" implies the soul existed with moral qualities before birth.

**Biblical contradiction:** Traditional Jewish and Christian theology teaches that God creates each soul at conception or birth (Psalm 139:13-16; Jeremiah 1:5), not that souls exist eternally before embodiment.

**Theological significance:** Preexistence of souls raises questions about the origin of sin, divine justice in soul assignment to bodies, and the nature of human personhood.

**Possible explanations:**
- Some scholars argue this is poetic language meaning the soul was created immediately before entering the body, not that it existed eternally
- The passage may reflect genuine adoption of Platonic philosophy, representing theological error from an orthodox Jewish or Christian perspective
- The author may be speaking figuratively within the Solomonic persona, not making a doctrinal claim

### 4. Body-Soul Dualism (Wisdom 9:15)

The statement "A perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind" presents a [dualistic anthropology foreign to biblical thought](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon).

**The problem:** This Neo-Platonic view regards the body as inherently burdensome to the soul, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between spirit and matter.

**Biblical contradiction:** The Old Testament views humans as integrated body-soul unities (Genesis 2:7). The New Testament affirms bodily resurrection and the goodness of embodied existence (1 Corinthians 15; Philippians 3:21). As Bruce Metzger notes, viewing the body as "a mere weight and clog to the soul (9:15)" is "foreign to both Old Testament and New alike."

**Theological significance:** This dualism influenced Gnostic heresies that viewed matter as evil and led to both ascetic rejection of the body and libertine disregard for bodily morality.

**Possible explanations:**
- The author may be expressing the frustration of human physical limitations without endorsing full Platonic dualism
- This represents genuine Hellenistic philosophical influence that later Christian theology corrected
- The passage addresses the corrupted state of humanity after the Fall, not the essential goodness of embodied existence

### 5. Immortality of Soul Rather Than Bodily Resurrection

The book consistently teaches [immortality of the soul](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon) (Wisdom 3:1-4; 5:15) but does not mention bodily resurrection.

**The problem:** This emphasis reflects Greek philosophical concepts rather than traditional Jewish eschatology, which anticipated bodily resurrection (Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19).

**Biblical contradiction:** Jewish apocalyptic literature (Daniel, 2 Maccabees) and the New Testament (1 Corinthians 15; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) teach resurrection of the dead, not mere survival of a disembodied soul.

**Theological significance:** The shift from resurrection to immortality represents a significant departure from Hebrew anthropology toward Greek dualism.

**Possible explanations:**
- The author addressed a Hellenistic audience using concepts they understood
- Immortality and resurrection are not necessarily contradictory; the book may assume resurrection while emphasizing the soul's survival
- This represents an intermediate stage in Jewish theological development
- The text contains genuine error from an orthodox biblical perspective

### 6. Possible Historical Inaccuracies in the Exodus Account

Chapters 10-19 retell Israel's history, particularly the Exodus, with [theological interpretation](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0259-94222012000100068) that sometimes diverges from the biblical narrative.

**The problem:** The author reorders events, combines plagues, and adds interpretive elements not found in Exodus, raising questions about historical accuracy versus theological meditation.

**Examples:**
- The sequence of plagues is rearranged to follow theological rather than chronological order
- Details about the plagues incorporate interpretive traditions not found in the Exodus account
- The emphasis on measure-for-measure justice imposes a framework not explicit in Exodus

**Possible explanations:**
- The book is explicitly midrashic and theological, not claiming to be historical chronicle
- Ancient readers understood this as theological reflection on sacred history, not historical reportage
- The "errors" are not mistakes but interpretive choices serving theological purposes

### Assessment

Many alleged "errors" in the Wisdom of Solomon depend on one's assumptions about biblical authority, the nature of progressive revelation, and the relationship between Scripture and philosophical thought. From a conservative perspective that affirms biblical inerrancy, several teachings (preexistent matter, soul-body dualism, soul preexistence) represent errors inconsistent with canonical Scripture. From a critical scholarly perspective, these reflect the author's Hellenistic philosophical framework and should be understood within that historical context. From a Catholic or Orthodox perspective that accepts the book as canonical, these teachings require careful theological interpretation in light of broader biblical revelation and church tradition.

## Contradictions

The Wisdom of Solomon contains several apparent contradictions, both internal tensions within the book itself and conflicts with other biblical texts. These have been subjects of ongoing scholarly debate and contribute to questions about the book's canonical status.

### Internal Contradictions

#### 1. Structure and Unity

The book presents structural inconsistencies that suggest compositional problems:

**The problem:** The work [lacks both an introductory verse and a regular conclusion](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15666a.htm), consisting of three independent sections with no clear connection. The third section (10:18-19:22) appears disconnected from the preceding material, as the speaker is no longer Solomon addressing earthly rulers but rather the author or Israelite community addressing God and recounting salvation history.

**Sections:**
- **Chapters 1-6**: Address to rulers about wisdom and righteousness
- **Chapters 7-9**: Solomon's first-person testimony about seeking wisdom
- **Chapters 10-19**: Third-person or communal voice recounting sacred history

The shifts in speaker, audience, and subject matter have led some scholars to propose composite authorship (multiple writers) or significant editorial combination of originally separate works.

**Scholarly explanation:** While earlier critics favored composite authorship theories, the majority of modern scholars defend the book's unity based on consistent vocabulary, theological outlook, and thematic connections. The structural variations may reflect deliberate rhetorical strategy within a sophisticated Hellenistic literary framework.

#### 2. Childlessness as Blessing

Wisdom 3:13-14 and 4:1 present [childlessness as potentially better than having wicked offspring](https://www.biblewise.com/bible_study/apocrypha/wisdom-of-solomon.php), contradicting traditional biblical values.

**The contradiction:** "Blessed is the barren woman who is undefiled...for at the visitation of souls she will have fruit. And blessed is the eunuch whose hands have done no lawless deed...for special favor will be shown him for his faithfulness" (Wisdom 3:13-14). "It is better to have no children and to have virtue" (Wisdom 4:1).

This reverses the Old Testament view that children are blessings from God (Psalm 127:3-5) and childlessness is a curse or source of shame (Genesis 30:1; 1 Samuel 1:5-8). The Torah specifically excludes eunuchs from the assembly (Deuteronomy 23:1).

**Possible explanations:**
- The author addresses the reality that righteous childlessness is better than having wicked children who dishonor God
- This reflects Hellenistic values that prioritized virtue over family and fertility
- The teaching represents development in Jewish theology, anticipating Jesus' and Paul's positive views of celibacy (Matthew 19:12; 1 Corinthians 7:8)
- Isaiah 56:3-5 already promised eunuchs a "monument and a name better than sons and daughters," so Wisdom develops this trajectory

### Contradictions with Other Biblical Books

#### 3. Creation from Formless Matter vs. Creation from Nothing

**Wisdom of Solomon:** "Your all-powerful hand, which created the world out of formless matter" (11:17)

**Genesis:** "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (1:1)

**John:** "All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being" (1:3)

**Hebrews:** "By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible" (11:3)

**The contradiction:** Wisdom suggests God shaped the universe from preexistent, uncreated matter (Platonic cosmology), while Genesis, John, and Hebrews affirm God created all things from nothing by divine command.

**Conservative explanation:** "Formless matter" refers to the "formless and void" condition described in Genesis 1:2, after the initial creation from nothing. The author assumes creatio ex nihilo but uses Platonic terminology to describe the shaping of chaos into cosmos.

**Critical explanation:** The author genuinely adopted Platonic cosmology, representing theological error or development inconsistent with later orthodox Christian doctrine.

#### 4. Immortality of Soul vs. Resurrection of Body

**Wisdom of Solomon:** "The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God...they are at peace...their hope is full of immortality" (3:1-4)

**Daniel:** "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (12:2)

**1 Corinthians:** "For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed" (15:52)

**The contradiction:** Wisdom emphasizes the survival and reward of disembodied souls, consistent with Greek philosophy. Daniel and Paul teach bodily resurrection, emphasizing the restoration of the whole person.

**Possible harmonization:** Immortality of the soul and bodily resurrection are not mutually exclusive. The soul survives death (intermediate state) until the general resurrection. Wisdom addresses the intermediate state; Paul addresses the final resurrection.

**Critical view:** [Wisdom reflects Hellenistic dualism](https://evidenceunseen.com/world-religions/roman-catholicism/the-apocrypha/the-wisdom-of-solomon) that "debases matter in contrast to the immortality of the soul, rather than the Judaic concept of the resurrection of the body," representing genuine theological contradiction.

#### 5. Body as Burden vs. Body as Good

**Wisdom of Solomon:** "A perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind" (9:15)

**Genesis:** "God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good" (1:31)

**1 Corinthians:** "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God?" (6:19)

**The contradiction:** Wisdom presents the body as inherently burdensome to the soul (Platonic dualism), while Genesis affirms the goodness of material creation and Paul teaches that the body is sacred.

**Possible explanation:** Wisdom 9:15 describes the fallen human condition, not the essential nature of embodiment. After sin, the body does burden the mind with temptation and limitation, but this is corruption, not creation's design.

**Critical view:** This represents genuine Platonic influence incompatible with biblical anthropology, which views humans as integrated body-soul unities.

#### 6. Satan's Role in Death's Origin

**Wisdom of Solomon:** "Through the devil's envy death entered the world" (2:24)

**Genesis:** Death enters through Adam's disobedience: "You are dust, and to dust you shall return" (3:19)

**Romans:** "Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin" (5:12)

**The contradiction:** Wisdom attributes death's origin to the devil's envy, while Genesis and Paul emphasize human sin and disobedience as the cause.

**Harmonization:** These accounts are complementary, not contradictory. Satan (the serpent in Genesis 3) tempted humanity out of envy, leading to human sin, which resulted in death. Wisdom highlights satanic agency; Genesis and Paul emphasize human responsibility.

#### 7. God's Universal Love vs. God's Particular Election

**Wisdom of Solomon:** "For thou lovest all things that exist, and hast loathing for none of the things which thou hast made...Thou sparest all things, for they are thine, O Lord who lovest the living" (11:24, 26)

**Deuteronomy:** "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession" (7:6)

**The apparent tension:** Wisdom emphasizes God's universal love for all creation, while much of the Old Testament stresses God's special love for and election of Israel.

**Harmonization:** Divine love can be both universal (God loves all creation) and particular (God has a special covenant relationship with Israel). God's universal mercy does not negate his special purposes for Israel.

**Significance:** Wisdom's universalist emphasis foreshadows New Testament teaching that God's salvation extends to all nations (John 3:16; Romans 10:12).

### Assessment

The contradictions in the Wisdom of Solomon reflect its nature as a transitional work bridging Jewish tradition and Hellenistic philosophy. Internal tensions regarding structure and audience may reflect sophisticated rhetorical strategy rather than compositional errors. More significant are the theological contradictions with other biblical books, particularly regarding creation, anthropology, and eschatology.

For those who accept Wisdom as canonical Scripture, these tensions require careful theological interpretation, viewing the book within its historical context while interpreting its teachings through the lens of broader biblical revelation. For those who deny its canonical status, these contradictions provide evidence that the book represents human wisdom influenced by Greek philosophy rather than divinely inspired Scripture fully consistent with the biblical canon. The debates surrounding these contradictions have shaped—and continue to shape—discussions of the book's authority and proper use in Christian theology.
