# The "inspired" word of God

The belief that every single verse in the Bible is the 'inspired' and inerrant word of God is a foundational doctrine for many Christians, often supported by quoting:

> All Scripture *is given by inspiration of God*, and *is* profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness... -- 2 Timothy 3:16 (NKJV)

However, very few people realise that this is a translation error and often deliberately quoted out of context.

## Translation Error

### The translation of "inspiration"

"Inspiration" is the wrong translation. According to [Strong's Concordance](https://biblehub.com/greek/2315.htm) original Greek is a combination of "God" and "blow" (breath) which implies spoken directly by God. There is only 1 occurrence of the word in the entire bible and that is why scholars derive it's meaning from the church's interpretation of 2 Timothy 3:16. However, the Churches have a problem "God breathed" or "God spoken" because the majority of bible text was not directly spoken by God. The bible include many human interpretations, commentaries, witness accounts, historical recordings, and so forth. Therefore, the most popular translation is "inspiration". 

However...

> Poirier argues that a close look at first- and second-century uses of theopneustos reveals that the traditional inspirationist understanding of **the term did not arise until the time of Origen in the early third century CE**, and that in every pre-Origen use of theopneustos the word instead means “***life-giving***.” -- [The Invention of the Inspired Text](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/invention-of-the-inspired-text-9780567698681/)

### The meaning of "and"

The Greek word καί (and) is correctly translated to English, but the meaning is often misunderstood.

καί is mostly used to be a **connective** like the English word "and", as it was translated in the NKJV. Many bible translators added the English word "is" to 2 Timothy 3:16 because of its connective properties. You will notice in the NKJV version that it is printed in italics which means it was not part of the original Greek manuscript.

However, unlike the English word "and", καί could also be **explanatory**. 

> Sometimes it has the consecutive meaning of "and so": e.g., Matthew 5:15, "and so it shineth"; Philippians 4:7, "and so the peace..."; Hebrews 3:19, "and so we see." -- [Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/Dictionary/viewTopic.cfm?topic=VT0003445)

For example, a phrase like "tō theō kai patri" in Ephesians 5:20 is often cited:

   * A simple connective reading would be: *"to the God and Father,"* which could imply two separate individuals.
   * An explanatory reading is: *"to God, that is, the Father,"* clarifying that "God" and "Father" refer to the same person.

This shows that the second part of the phrase (the Father) explains or specifies the first part (God). Determining whether καί is used this way depends entirely on the grammar and context of the sentence.

### Context

Paul warns in his letter about deceptive doctrines and fables and urge his followers to rather preach God's word ("Holy Scriptures") which is "God breathed" and "profitable".

> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, **deceiving and being deceived**.
>
> But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. **All scripture *God breathed, that is,* profitable** for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 
>
> I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: 
>
> Preach **the word!** 
>
> Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will **not endure sound doctrine**, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be **turned aside to fables**. 
>
> -- 2 Timothy 3:13-4:4 (based on NKJV)

Technically [Bible scriptures did not even exist until the second century](/kingdom/church/history/vulgate). Paul was referring to [the "scriptures"](https://biblehub.com/greek/1124.htm), known today as "the Old Testament", which they studied in their lifetimes.

## Idolising the Bible

> Sola scriptura (Latin for 'by scripture alone') is a Christian theological doctrine held by most Protestant Christian denominations, in particular the Lutheran and Reformed traditions, that posits the Bible as **the sole infallible source of authority** for Christian faith and practice. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura)

Other religions and the secular system also uses rule books or laws to dictate people's expected behaviours. Without a relationship with God or with the people, this system is essential to bring order and unity in a community.

Jesus told the Jews:

> You search the Scriptures, for in them **you think you have eternal life**; and these are they which testify of me. But you are not willing to **come to me** that you may have life. -- John 5:39-40 (NKJV)

This reveals a timeless danger: substituting the study of scripture for a direct relationship with God, echoing the first sin of pursuing knowledge apart from His guidance (Genesis 3).

## Conclusion

The original Greek translation, and the surrounding context of 2 Timothy 3:16 reveals that not all bible scriptures are equally important. The word revealed by God Himself is far more important than the instructions, commentaries or advice of saints.

Therefore, we must seek the guidance of the Author Himself, instead of relying on the interpretations of Christian people (including this website).
