# Bible Translations

The bible is possibly one of the most difficult books to translate, because the source texts are from different languages and cultures written over thousands of years by different authors in different styles and circumstances. Certain words or phrases are impossible to accurately translate because of a lack of vocabulary in the English language. 

On top of that we no longer have the original scriptures in their original form as it was written by the original authors.  

Therefore, it is unsurprising that so many different bible translations exist today.

Many people have critiqued the bible for its redundancy of providing the same messages in different ways, but this could actually be considered a "backup feature". In modern Computer Science, we still use redundancy to store data on unreliable mediums. Likewise, with bible translations one will find that although different sources of text exist, the content is mostly the same with only a few [differences](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/translations/differences). When these independent copies found at different sites confirm each other, it means they were reliably copied.

Therefore, one should never base a new doctrine on 1 isolated verse alone as this could lead to wrong [interpretations](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations). Instead consider the context and a confirmed patterns which should preferably be authored from different witnesses.
